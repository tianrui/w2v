5.0 out of 5 starsLIKE A BAWSS!!!!Omg!!!Big win does it again!!I was waiting so long for mlb but now i cant stop playing this!The best part is the quest for the cup.There is so much stuff that you have to try it yourself.4.0 out of 5 starsCoin FlipI like the game but there are many negatives.Hockey is an unpredictable game but a team of gold card players (65 rating) would never lose to a start up team of bronze players (45 rating) as often as that occurs.The constant expiration of player's contracts is annoying if you play the game a lot.Having to spend 75 big bucks to renegotiate a contract after say six 20 game renewals is too expensive.Bronze player packs have an excess number of "injury free" cards compared to the ones you really want.I end up selling most of them.After buying numerous bronze packs you would like to be able to use the skill increase cards oftener than you are allowed to.You should be rewarded more for buying the impact cards.I reach the maximum of 400 cards constantly and have to stop the game to sell the excess too often.The gold card packs for 10 big bucks seldom include a gold card player.If you want to win you might as well spend $20-30 right off and get some gold card players at least.By playing the "Quest for the Cup" you often get opportunities to buy gold card players at a reduced rate even if you lose almost every game in that tourney.5.0 out of 5 starsFive Starsawesome5.0 out of 5 starsAmazing!!!This is Amazing!!!The only thing is the contract renewals thing then every team would be amazing.You should totally get this.5.0

re-playability.For a quick summary, Think Team fortress 2 with Jetpacks set in a futuristic world of warcraft.It is 100% shooter, that has a so much to do with single player, co-op, team games and a risk style territory meta game.You can customise each character you create with outfits, colours and skills.If you love games, this is the perfect FPS MMO RPG hybrid that contains the best of all worlds from a game company that really cares.If you are still not sure, there is a demo from their main website, but I would urge you just to buy it now5.0 out of 5 starsAwesome.This game is the absolute best sports game I have ever played.I hope that the Rugby Union group takes note and makes their games the same way1.0 out of 5 starsThe sales went down good but the game sucksThe sales went down good but the game sucks.It not played like the real rugby game.Had an import rugby game that was much better.4.0 out of 5 starsmy son loves itWe didn't give it 5 stars only because he said he's still trying to get use to the controls.. but he loves playing it.5.0 out of 5 starsFive StarsI am very happy with this game!Thank You5.0 out of 5 starsFive StarsGreat game4.0 out of 5 starsThe best cricket gam I have playedThe best cricket gam I have played.The controls and too many, utilizes all the keys on the joystick, but it gives an as close to the real as possible feel due to the wide range of shot and control options you get.5.0 out of 5 starsBecauses it's worth itI purchased this and can say this is by far the best cricket game made to this day.However, I feel it could use a lot of the features from the '09 Ashes, such as the commentary, 'common sense' for the players in terms of fielding mostly run outs.Fielding is good however, the catching can be too easy, whereas the Ashes '09 catches were much harder to take.The Umpires are not consistent, I am referring to wides and no balls.I expect them to make bad decisions hence the reason we have DRS (which is a big plus) but leg side wides and even outside off wides, are not called as often as they should be.I rated this at five stars because compared to other cricket games, this is the best.Anyone who appreciates cricket and know the importance or relevance of Sir Don Bradman would value the steelbook.Was not able to play online but the career mode is great, as you progress in your career, you may get chances to play in the IPL or Australian leagues and your nation.Worth every cent!!!!1.0 out of 5 starsI can see that the game itself is terrific and that an out and out cricket fan will ...My beef with this product is that it can't be played off-line.If I'd known that, I would never had bought it.I can see that the game itself is terrific and that an out and out cricket fan will have a great time with it.It should be made clear in the product review that the buyer has to subscribe to Steam in order to play the game.After the buyer subscribes, he/she is then informed that you can only access the game via your online Steam account.Also the controller received was different from the one shown in the online manual.Not too impressed with any of this.If you are looking for a stand alone game, this one isn't for you.Be aware that you will HAVE to open a Steam account and will be able to play the game ONLY by going through your Steam account.5.0 out of 5 starsExceeded my expectations... Nice gameI was bit skeptical about the play experience, but once you get some in the net session and practice ground session, it is really interesting to play this game.The career mode makes it really interesting.This is one of the best cricket game I have played and it is fun to play.Already received few updates and it is very well supported by the development team as of now.You won't be disappointed.But check the system requirements before you buy this game.5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent Game, Great UI and lovely GraphicsThis is an Awesome Game.The UI rocks.Game Modes are excellent.Love playing this all day.Only drawback is whenever you need a single, you will never know if the ball is in a safe land or near to fielders.Apart from this, it has everything amazing.Love it...5.0 out of

neither game has licences from all the countries that competed in last year's world cup, which makes them about even.As an IRFU fan, I was a bit dissapointed to not be able to play as BOD or O'Gara, but for what it's worth, Jonah's game did get the licensing from the All Blacks.What sets this game apart from the competition is the inclusion of custom players and clubs (so I can, with a little work, play each country with their original RWC players).I have yet to play this with a gamepad (it's en route), but I did find the keyboard controls were a bit unresponsive.The tutorials were a great way to understand how the interface works.Although I am a Steam member, I would've liked to have been able to play the game right out of the box (I ordered the DVD version from Amazon, not the digital version from Steam), instead of having to run Steam, run the installer, and then wait for Steam to update it.4.0 out of 5 starsGreatgreat game, good graphics but the game is a bit old and the newer version is out, installation can be a pain with all the extra programmes that are needed(stream).overall great quality.Recommend the newer version...Jonah Lamu Rugby Challenge 23.0 out of 5 starsThree StarsGood service, but the game was just OK1.0 out of 5 starsTennis Bat very badI brought a tennis bat from this site.After playing for 15 minutes with tennis ball the handle was loose and it is making a cracking sound.Please don't buy from this site because when i asked them to replace they are saying that handle going loose is not a defect.5.0 out of 5 starsExactly what it isWe purchased this for a Shawn of the Dead "zombie repellent" piece for our wall.While this probably wouldn't last against real zombies, works great for a life-size replica.4.0 out of 5 starsNice batThe bat was good.I used it with tennis ball.Very good quality; a little on the heavier side.I would recommend this bat to anyone looking for a good bat at a low price.5.0 out of 5 starsGreat recreational cricket batI have a more expensive Gray-Nicolls practice bat, and this bat that I bought as a present for my sister seems just as good for its intended use.Since it was a recent purchase, I cannot comment on the bat's durability, but the relatively light weight is nice for those of us just looking for fun.3.0 out of 5 starsbad packagingThe product itself doesn't have much problem except a couple of small chipping on the edge.The packaging is bad, the box is flimsy and has holes on it, there is no cushioning materials in it, the bat is moving around and hitting the box.5.0 out of 5 starsWOWwell THE BIGGEST problem, game is not released to us or Canada, so i had to order it from UK.The game-play and graphics are second to none, i have never seen a game quite like The Ashes, graphics are similar to NBA 2K10, with players facial expressions and swatting.you pretty much can play all the shots like in a real game mid-on, off etc....the bowling is also realistic with drift, dusras spin.The one feature, i enjoy the most is the ability to change how old the pitch is, i.e one game old two games old etc.It supports trophies so you will have new trophy every time you complete a challenge in a game.The game is good but needs a patch released for fielding glitches, its very difficult to catch a ball, believe me i have played over 50hrs of it.on my good day i am able to complete only 80% of all catches.its not fully licensed by all cricket boards, so they have purposely misspelled the names of all the counties players except Australia and England.I would expect product like it, to be fully licensed.sometimes its hard to hit the ball but i have realized once you have passed the learning curve it almost becomes second nature.overall, the game is 9/10.i personally feel its a step in the right direction as far as cricket games are concerned for xbox, and ps3.yes even though this game is PAL, format it play with ps3 in united states, you have to make sure you are using HDMI cables and HDTV5.0 out of 5 stars5 Star plus gameIn terms of game modes there's everything here most cricket fans will want.The Ashes themselves are the main draw, backed up by the proper licence (although we're not sure if player likenesses were part of that deal, as most only vaguely match their real life counterparts).Outside of this test series mode you've got One Day and 20 over matches, although neither is a licensed tournament, so there's no properly named Twenty20.There are numerous challenges to complete too, set by legends Sir Ian Botham and Shane Warne.Although the batting and bowling is solid enough, the on-field presentation is lacking slightly.Player models and stadiums are decent, but the animations are clunky and don't blend into one another well at all.There's also a strange delay when a wicket is taken, meaning you'll know you're out but the fielders won't react.Then a second later they'll all leap into the air to celebrate.For a fairly average looking game the frame rate isn't too hot either, frequently appearing a fraction too slow.Commentary is decent and the voice work by Beefy and Warne is solid, if a little sterile, but on the whole it's not a game to show off to your mates.Ashes Cricket 2009 is a solid recreation of the sport and this summer's big sporting event, but it's lacking spark and feels a little slight in terms of depth.Play with a friend as opposed to the AI and you'll likely be able to have fun up to and beyond the end of the Ashes series, but as a next-gen sports sim it doesn't feel as though Codemasters has done enough to push the series forward.3.0 out of 5 starsAshes 2009Ashes 2009 could have been better , if not for noticeable glitches in game play .While faulty umpiring occasionally makes it more realistic , it is overdone.Another thing is the fielding.The fielding is simply horrific.The appealing,too is overdone Otherwise, the game was good.The Hawk-Eye technology is good for the game .There is a Legends Coaching .What made me buy this game, however, was the online game play.Although it is sometimes hard to find an opponent , it will all pay off in the end.But beware!Your opponent can quit the match at any time.Yet another downside!Another thing in the game is' The Pavillion' In there , you can see all the trophies and stadia you have unlocked.You can also check out the world records.In the game itself, you can pick one of 12 teams.You can then play a 20 over , 50 over or the longest form, the grueling test match .There are three difficulties.Another 'up' is the customization.You can change the player's name, his appearance,his kit or you can edit his skills.Of course, you cannot edit the Aussies or English.5.0 out of 5 starsTally Ho Good Time!Cricket games have never captured the public imagination like, say, football games, mainly because a more complex sport is bound to breed a less-easily-grasped video game.But Codemasters' Brian Lara-branded games of yore consistently outshone their rivals, and finally, the Britsoft publisher has acquired the plum cricketing licence: the Ashes.It's a big shame that Ashes Cricket 2009 didn't make it to the crease in time for the first Test in Cardiff, but at least it's a classy and thoroughly playable effort.4.0 out of 5 starsWorth buyingI recently bought Don Bradman 14 ps3 version.After playing for 4 days, rather than enjoying, all I did was to master the game.After returning it, I purchased ashes 2009 ps3.I should say that this is the best one, I really like it.I would've given 5 stars if the game permits editing player names.5.0 out of 5 starsJust wait a little bitThe new 3ds is pretty amazing with 3 times faster speed nice firm buttons but buyer beware the system is region lock so you can't play American games on the system and the language is locked to Japanese but should be out in America and Europe in 1st quarter 20151.0 out of 5 starsBought it from STANDARD JAPAN, the product arrived DEAD ...Bought it from STANDARD JAPAN, the product arrived DEAD ON ARRIVAL (DOA) with error 8046, why can't they test the product before sending it?It was supposed to be a Christmas present and now I have to send it back and wait God knows how long for a refund (Waste of time and money).5.0 out of 5 starsGreat for studying Japanese once you've reached an intermediate level ...Exactly what I wanted.Great for studying Japanese once you've reached an intermediate level and can read a few hundred kanji.Some games, like  have furigana over all of the kanji, making it easy to search for words in a dictionary while you play.My only issue is that the volume slider is a little wobbly.I don't know what to make of that.I wonder if it's typical.5.0 out of 5 starsIt's great!I love itIt's great!I love it, it's very nice and comfortable in my small hands.If you know Japanese, and you like the standard size new Nintendo 3DS, I recommend picking either the White or Black of this.5.0 out of 5 starsNerdy glory!Solid little system with excellent battery life!If you aren't myopic or picky about screen resolution/size, this is the perfect hand held!2.0 out of 5 starsIf this is the life of a GM, count me outWhen I first heard about MLB Front Office Manager I was very excited.I've always enjoyed the management aspect of sports games and usually spend much more time managing and toying with the rosters than I do "playing" the sport itself.Enter MLB FOM.My sports prayers have been answered, right?Not really.I've played through one season, and I can't even bring myself to get through my second offseason as a GM (I'll explain below).So with out further ado, lets get down to the good, the bad and the OMG what where they thinking?The Good: The interface is clean and the options are incredibly realistic.It runs pretty smooth.Anything you could want management wise in sports game.Not only can you offer arbitration, participate in the Rule 5 draft, and scout the world for talent, but you can also offer incentives, control your 40 man roster, and run every imaginable aspect of a baseball front office.You get frequent email updates informing you of various things around the league, but these quickly become a nuisance.The Bad: Where to start?The music is bad but that doesn't really matter.Trades are horrible.Its nearly impossible to trade for anyone, even when they are on the trade block, unless you grossly overpay in talent.What's mind bending is that when the AI makes trades, they seem to be almost laughable, but when a real player gets involved, the gloves come off.There is no way to gauge a players interest in resigning, an by the time you know they aren't interested in your bid, they have signed with someone else.The menus are tedious and you can't sort by things that really matter, like overall talent rating, the ability to hit for power or average, etc, on most screens.In fact, the only way to find out a players skill ratings is to go player by player and look at their info on a separate screen.This makes scouting for hidden talent in other teams farm systems incredibly time consuming and not enjoyable.The fact that the players don't seem to evolve during the season regardless of how good or bad the play throughout the year.The only times I have seen ratings change is when the calender goes from Dec 31 to Jan 1.The big problem with this is that you can vastly overpay for players when you resign them or nab them on the free market.I resigned a 2B to start (rated 50, more on that in the next section) only to see him drop to 35 Jan 1st.he went from being my starter to not even making the MLB squad.Ratings should change before you resign players or sign free agents.Also, most teams seem to resign their free agents before the signing period starts, so there are very few good options to upgrade your team in the offseason.The OMG What Where They Thinking: The three things that drive me crazy in this game: The way you resign your own players, the ratings system for players, and random "game manager mode."First, resigning players.Negotiating your MLB players is fine.What kills me is negotiating with all the minor league-ers in AAA, AA, A+, A, and SS (rookie league).The problem is that every single minor player will gladly except a minor league contact (does not count against your budget) for 1 year.If you offer more than 1 year they will reject you 99 out of 100 times unless you offer a lot more money.The problem?You have to go into every single player and offer them a deal.This wouldn't be so bad if the game left you at the screen where you resigned your minor leaguer.But, instead, it jumps you back to the MLB tab.So you have to click on the minor league level tab every time you want to resign a minor leaguer.Whats worse is that you can't even sort them by overall talent, so you have to look at each player individually before going back and offering a contract.So if you have 25 players at each minor league level (5) and then you have to click three times per player (once for the level tab, once to check their ratings and once to offer them a deal, you are looking at 375 clicks.It became so time consuming that I gave up before I finished with the AAA squad.Secondly, they ratings are very strange.They range from 20-80, where most games range 0-100.The problem here is that you end up with the vast majority of players falling between 45-55.Anything over 60 is a "great player" and 70 or over is elite.Somehow, Mark Texiera is only rated 60!In fact, the only player rated 80 is that certain picture the Yanks threw a ton of cash at earlier this year.Its just a very odd way to rank, makes some players seem ranked well below their skills and makes you feel like you are overpaying for everyone.Lastly, there is a mode where you can "manage" your team on the field.You can't play anyone, its greatly sped up, you can't really "scout" your talent, and the presentation is horrible.I really wonder why they added this feature at all.It would have ben better if they added commentators or something.Also, on a side note, you can't even focus on certain players to help them develop.I could go on but i'll stop.The Verdict: If you are looking for a game that resembles work more than it does entertainment then this game is for you!You get the feeling as you plod along playing this game that 2K Games just threw this game out there to milk the last untapped segment of their MLB License.There are so many things that could have been better.One thing I didn't rant on was the interface.They took this game directy from their XBox360 platform.I mean this literally, and they didn't even bother to remove the xbox icon buttons telling you how to differnt things.If you do decide to get this game make sure you but a PC Xbos usb controller.Also, many of the features seem like they should have been side notes added to their main flagship, MLB 2k'9.If you are looking for a great gaming experience that mixes fun, game play, and management AND you have a PS2 or a PS3, save you money and buy MLB The Show 09 when it comes out.Its the best baseball game out there, has many of the management features that this games has AND they have added the rule 5 draft and arbitration for the upcoming release.1.0 out of 5 starsA Terribly Flawed AttemptEven though you can't actually pitch, bat, or field in this game, the chance to simulate being a GM with real players, trades, waivers, free agents, the Rule V draft, and sabermetric stats, and then watch the games, sounded like fun to me.It's not, though, because it doesn't get any of those things right.For example: 1.The statistics are incorrect.If your starting pitcher gives you two innings, but your team wins the game, the starter still gets the win.The game is filled with misinterpretations of the basic rules of baseball, like this one.2.There is no way to sort players by their skills.Clicking on each player in every league one-at-a-time, and scribbling the results on a spreadsheet, makes the game unrealistic and tedious at the same time.3.The players, especially the stars, seem to have been assigned skill levels based on random chance, rather than an appraisal of their abilities or statistics.Also, players' skill ratings change dramatically from year to year, often with no relationship whatsoever to their age, health, or stats.(Using the realistic 20 to 80 rating scale is great, but the ratings the game assigns to the players are random, and change randomly.)4.Unlike in real baseball, you can immediately trade anyone you just signed as a free agent.In real baseball, you have to wait until midseason to trade a free agent that you signed that year.5.Unlike in real baseball, you can call up to the majors and send down to the minors players (who have options) without the mandatory ten day waiting period.6.No lists of top prospects, either in the aggregate or by position, are maintained.(I'm not convinced that the AI is sufficient to figure out who the top prospects are, anyway.)7.The AI is far more artificial than intelligent.Top prospects like Mat Gamel are placed on waivers in 2009 (without any reason, such as an injury).The computer-controlled general mangers lack distinct philosophies and strategies.8.Even if you create your own players or edit the existing ones, you cannot use your edits in all aspects of the game.The players you create or edit are restricted to certain game modes.In short, this game is not worth your money; it wouldn't even be worth playing if it were free.In my opinion, it is the direct result of the lack of competition in baseball games that began when MLB sold the exclusive rights to make baseball games to 2K Sports.1.0 out of 5 starsVideo Card standards make this game a risk!Before you purchase this game, make sure you validate that your video card meets standards - or you'll waste $40 on a non-returnable game!2k admits on their forum that most (MOST!)on-board video cards cannot run this game!!!My computer is 2 years old, I upgraded my video card at the time, and it's now too outdated to run this game.This is not just my issue, it's all over the 2k forums - so many people have been posting about this issue... furious that 2k made this game for such a narrow consumer group.Not to mention their Customer Service is a joke and doesn't respond promptly or with any apology or assistance.3.0 out of 5 starsReally not as bad as most people sayAs a UK resident I have only recently been able to purchase this game because it was never released outside of North America and all (legitimate) download sites don't allow the game to be purchased outside of the original licensed territories.The game recently became available on the UK Amazon site so as a huge baseball and sports management fan I decided to shell out the twelve or so bucks and suck it up if the game is as terrible as all the reviews say.I don't know if its because I'm running the game on a 3 month old computer which handles the processing better than the ones available two years ago but seriously, I haven't seen any of the stats glitches that rendered the game unplayable for many people.Admittedly I have only played one full season but - I didn't 'lose' any players on the 40 man roster after spring training My Detroit Tigers went 79-83 (exactly the same record as 2008, although I thought I had upgraded quite well in the offseason) with a realistic Pitching Staff ERA of 4.61, team BA .272 and the HR, SB and other 'Counting' stats were all believable.I didn't check every box score but the pitcher wins and losses seemed to tally with their innings piched, I certainly never saw wins awarded to starters who didn't go at least five innings.It isn't THAT much hard work looking through the minors for talented players on other teams, for the Rule 5 draft you can ignore anybody that has a salary number and/or is less than 22 years old.Just look at players with an 'Overall' of 40 or higher to cut out the dross, it literally took me less than an hour to do this, some people spend longer than that setting up leagues in OOTP so I don't see it is a waste of time.The interface IS initially clunky, but you only have to find out where information is once to remember it in future.Although it would be nice to know how to delete e-mails - if that is actually possible.The 40 man roster - you don't HAVE to have 40 players on there at the start of the season, I checked out the real 40 man rosters on ESPN and almost none of the teams actually has 40 players on there.Some only have 32-34 which makes sense because you have to make allowances for all the 15 day DL guys that count towards the total.I don't know why so many people 'lost' players after spring training but maybe they hadn't added every guy with a Major League contract from their farm system and the game can't cope with that?A big deal seems to be the 'problem' when you move a player into your active roster to replace an injured guy then have to find room for him somewhere in the minors when the injured player comes back.Several reviews go on about having to go into every level of your farm system making adjustments but theres a really simple answer.When the guy on the DL is due to come back go into the extended roster screen for the level you want to send his replacement player to and put them in an empty slot there.That frees up the spot on your active roster and allows you to move the original guy back from the DL.The annoying thing about the 40 man roster is your unnamed Manager only ever plays the starters on the depth chart in Spring Training, if you want your back ups to play a few games you have to alter the depth charts accordingly.The unnamed Manager thing BTW is also frustrating..A baseball GM simulation where you can't hire or fire the field manager?I'm sure many many people did have serious issues with this game when it first came out and the lack of any kind of support from 2K Sports would lead you to believe that these problems couldn't have been fixed via a simple patch so they didn't bother trying.Some games run weird on AMD processors because they process instructions differently than INTEL, maybe this has something to do with it, who knows?For me, I have been pleasantly surprised at the lack of game killing glitches while still recognising that there are problems with the gameplay overall.It can be hard work, but when I started videogaming on a ZX80 you had to map out whole game worlds yourself so I'm not bothered about keeping a few handwritten lists besides me when I play...I think you have to have a lot of patience to get anything out of this and it really appeals more to gamers who love things like Football Manager, the hardcore soccer simulation that is way more complicated than this but sells millions of copies every year, there was a similar reaction when EA released Head Coach a few years ago, I don't think many American gamers like spending twenty minutes organising a training session or hiring Defensive Line assistant coaches but we Brits consider that to be 'immersive'...On the other hand if the game was throwing up utterly random stats and teams were going 3-159 like I have read about it would be unplayable, so i feel the pain of those who shelled out full price for something that was utterly flawed for them.1.0 out of 5 starsCheck your graphics card specsOn both my relatively new computers -- one desktop, one laptop -- both name brand machines, I couldn't get this game to run because of graphics card incompatibility.Yep, I should have double checked, but given the age of my machines and never having had any problems with other popular video games purchased I wound up sadly disappointed.5.0 out of 5 starsFive StarsThis is the best game i've ever played and my Gamer Score is 121k :/4.0 out of 5 starsI like it a lotI like it a lot.Looks like the best cricket game available.The graphics could be better.Also the commentary,stadiums etc could be more realistic with more options.4.0 out of 5 starsGood game.Good game..Lot of controls makes it entertaining... Graphics could be improved.. Real names of played would have made it more fun.5.0 out of 5 starsFive StarsFantastic game, I don't see myself getting rid of this anytime soon.Best cricket game I've played so far2.0 out of 5 starsFun for a day.This game is pretty much $#!+, but it's pretty much the only cricket game I could find that worked on US systems.$60 is way too much for a game of this quality.If you find it for like $20, pick it up if you are a fan of cricket and dont mind spending $20 on something fun for the afternoon.Anything more than $20 spent on this game is your own fault.Don't get me wrong, It is fun...but not $60 fun.If you must play cricket I suggest just go outside and play because it's less tiresome.1.0 out of 5 starsNot for hard tennisThis bat is not for hard tennis balls.I only hit 3 balls and bat broke1.0 out of 5 starsOne StarIts Really BAd.It got broken within a Day!!1.0 out of 5 starsOne StarWorst bat ever bought from amazon.Broke in one week.4.0 out of 5 starsPES is coming back...although Fifa is still the king.Probably should have both to be sure.Ok, so let's get the bad out of the way - this franchise was overtaken but Fifa a few years ago and to date has not really recovered.Fifa's engine, graphics and control were way out in front and PES stagnated.Coupled with the fact that Fifa has all the official licenses, squads, team names, kits and leagues, this two horse race for the ultimate soccer sim has been very one-sided recently.This year however, there appears to be some magic back in the PES world.The game plays very fluidly and isn't as predictable as it has been in recent years.The referee used to be terribly over-zealous - that appears to have been fixed.The chip throughball is no longer as easy and deadly (and boring) as it used to be.The graphics are still not as realistic as Fifa's; but the player movement is slick and recognisable - even though players' shirts don't billow in the wind like their Fifa counterparts.Anyway, it's probably not fair to spend the whole review comparing this franchise to its megalomaniac bigger brother, but that is I suppose what most users will be visiting the reviews to find out.I would say that for playing with friends and online, this game is a great passtime.But, if you must have all the official names, stadiums and teams, then Fifa's still your baby.5.0 out of 5 starsAwesome soundtrackI think this game is for true soccer or futbol fans and thats why fifa has competition.I takes real skill and thought to win in this game.Also if you like alternative music this soundtrack is for you.Miracle Mile is just one of the great songs on here.Sometimes I literally wait to atart a match till a song is over.Nest soundtrack in my opinion since watchdogs.Almost NO RAP!!I LOVE IT!!Another instance of the game telling you it isnt for "Snoop Dogg" like fifas commercials.Buy this if you want to.play a game that requires skill, thinking, and is for true fans.ONE THING THAT SUCKS IS THE ENGLISH LEAGUE TEAMS ARE NOT LICENSED SO THEY ARE NOT HERE5.0 out of 5 starsBetter than FIFA 2015 for sureI really LOVE this game, and I can say this is the best soccer/football game in the market now.FIFA 2015 lost the battle for sure this time.5.0 out of 5 starsPro Evo is finally back!Great game.Blows FIFA 15 out of the water in terms of overall gameplay.Been waiting for Pro Evo to get back to its roots.5.0 out of 5 starsFive Starsit is a really great game2.0 out of 5 starsA Whole Different Experience, But Not For The BetterSo far, disappointing.In spite of how ridiculously greedy EA is, in spite of the terrible servers, in spite of the dozens of times I've wanted to kick the wall over some impossible pass my opponent did, I stuck to FIFA for over a decade now.This resolve is now wavering.I've played FIFA for a while now, and I don't always liked the changes, but I adapted, usually pretty easily, even after long periods of inactivity due to life being difficult.This time, however, the changes have made the game generally unpleasant to play.As other reviewers have said, the learning curve is very steep.What do I mean with this?Example: I've always favored possession and multiples passes to build up a play, like with tiki-taka.Now this is impossible.Passes must be extremely precise, both in direction and in power, to reach its destination.Otherwise, is a constant stream of turnovers.I found myself struggling to make any kind of goal that wasn't a header, a style that has historically been a last resource for me.Playing against the AI in World Class, something that used to a fairly easy task for me, is now frustrating and just not fun.Defending is harder than ever, sliding tackles are near impossible, and more often than not the AI will break your hips without even trying.The game itself is buggy.It froze on me 2 times in less than a day.The servers, as usual, are down a great deal of time.As usual, if you get kicked over the server, you are penalized with a 3-0 loss.And there goes another controller.I'm just beginning to learn the new defensive and offensive moves, but I doubt they'll make a big difference.This is a very different mechanic, but not for the better.Looking at the reviews for PES, this might just be the year when I change up.I wish I didn't have to.1.0 out of 5 starsGood ideas with TERRIBLE exectutionI'll start off by saying that I have been playing FIFA for the past 8 years.I am generally competitive and have mastered Fifa with every release.I am not an inexperienced player and I am really concerned with learning a game in and out.This year's Fifa is a disaster!While there are some good things that prevent inexperienced players from abusing pace and running and scoring, there are a lot of bad things.It seems as if they tried to make the game more realistic without bothering to change the game mechanics.The result is a game where it is a constant battle for possession and scoring is near impossible even with properley timed passes and through balls.This game is very frustrating to play and is honestly the biggest step back EA have taken in the franchise.This game has some changes that I could master, but the fun has been taken out of it, so I doubt I will bother.The game had become a chore and pain.This game is generally unplayable due to the overpowered defensive AI.Oh and forget about having a shot, there are blocks Constantly!Whether it be a head, arm, leg or whatever else, the defensive AI will always find a way to block your shots.I think they tried to hard with this one.Overall very dissapointed.1.0 out of 5 starsHave some spare controllers on hand.As someone who has played tons of other fifa games, this game disappoints and frustrates me to no end, Sure there have been plenty of good changes to where people cannot abuse pace anymore and actually have to work the ball down the field.The defenders are smarter about interceptions as well as the midfielders.Draft mode is cool and adds a new dynamic to FUT, however it has a decently large entry fee of 15k coins or 300 fifa points.Then the frustration starts.Some people have praised this game for it's new passing mechanics, but I just don't see it.You have to be a trained navy seal sniper to hit passes accurately.Many times a pass overlooks the player who it was obviously intended for and goes straight to the other team.Other times the power bar (even with a driven pass) means nothing and the ball chooses how fast it wants to go.Sometimes it takes me 4 Y while pointing down to the right-side corner of the field on counter-attacks for the game to realize "OH!you wanted to give a ball to your wing!Too bad!He's now offside and you missed you chance!"First touches are absolutely dismal.Even while holding LT the ball goes out of control and I can't trust passes between defenders or back to the goalie in fear of the first touch being unpredictable and unreliable.Touches in the midfield or the attacking third have a mind of their own cutting off passes and easy shots.Any goalkeeper with an 80+ rating is incredibly strong.Andre Ter Stegen (82 OVR) will make 14 saves in the first half and another 7 in the second with ease, meanwhile Mingolet (78 OVR) struggles to block anything.It's nice to have your own keeper be a little smarter now, but to see average keepers make saves worthy of goalkeeper Valhalla is a little ridiculous.Packs are useless at this point.Good luck finding anyone over 80 because all you're getting is going to be some non-rare 70-something overall player.The officiating in this game is the dumbest I have ever seen referees.Many many "fouls" happen after barely laying a shoulder on a midfielder, or fouls are called after a clean slide happened to get the ball first, clear it, and just happen to continue into a player.And good luck with PK's, because you can have your fingers off all buttons on the controller and just hold the left stick while bodying a player and your defender feels inclined to shove the attacker down.It happened in 75% of the online games I have played.The one thing this game got right was expanded price ranges in UT, and the soundtrack.Most of the other modes play fine but the gameplay itself is incredibly frustrating and you will constantly be asking yourself "Why?!"as you're playing as you question whether or not the players om the field are toddlers or Ronaldo.This game has a learning curve the size of Everest, and you better have a stress ball on hand while getting to learn it.3.0 out of 5 starsI was never this bad at FIFA until I came across this one.....All I do is play online and I don't know what it is, but I can not win a game if my life depended on it.I lost 10 straight yesterday and played 5 games today, I only won 2 of those (1 was because the opponent hit the ball in his own net).I am really struggling, it seems like it really changed a whole lot from Fifa 15.There's lots of times where it's a real nightmare, just trying to get close to the net.The passing, crosses, headers, it seems like they made it a hell of a lot harder to score in this one.My team is Bayern Mnich (rated 86) and there is no reason why I should be getting my ass handed to me every single time, there's been many times where I want to put my hand through the wall or the tv screen.I am getting so sick and tired of losing every damn time.I just go into each game now expecting to lose so I don't get mad anymore.I guess I just got to practice some more and hopefully I'll get use to it.What do you guys think of it?Are you struggling as well or is it all smooth sailing for you guys?I guess this really isn't a review, it's more of how a personal opinion and of how I feel about this game.If this keeps up, I might just have to hang up my Fifa boots and give PES a whirl.Preparing myself for all the negative comments I will receive......1.0 out of 5 starsThe worst FIFA in a decade.Let's be honest, FIFA has been in rapid decline since around 09/10.This year's version is far and away the worst.The game AI makes it impossible for a player competent in soccer knowledge to execute even the simplest of moves.Players fail to run into open space even in "All out attack" mentality.Passes are auto-directed towards teammates that are marked rather than those that are in space and free.The worst part about this game is the scripting that goes into the online matches.For those new to the FIFA franchise, the development team of this game has, over the past 5 years, decided to add code into the game that disrupts the flow of the game by favoring one player over another.The player being favored will win the majority of 50/50 duels and his players will be able to turn quicker and pass with more power and accuracy.Why is this annoying?Because there is no need for it.I have literally had games where i out-possess an opponent 70/30 and will outshoot them by a drastic margin, yet the game decides that the opponent will win.What happens next?A random penalty for a "foul".A wayward shot takes an "unfortunate" deflection.My player misses an open goal.Some of you may be reading and be thinking: "But them russians, correlation does not imply causation".Believe me, I have played hundreds of games online.I know scripting is in the game (it has been data mined - see youtube).This one "feature" has killed the franchise for those of us that actually enjoy/understand soccer.I am done with FIFA.I am glad PES has released a new game.Here's hoping that more people migrate to that franchise and leave EA to die.1.0 out of 5 starsThis game is so bad it will make you sadFor whatever sport this game is intending to be, maybe it's halfway decent, but that sport sure isn't rugby.Maybe I'm wrong, but I've never really experienced that after a ruck is formed, a handful of forwards decide to just stand there, offside, behind of the OTHER team's ruck, with no real intention of moving.Additionally, there appears to really only be one way of consistently scoring a try.Pass the ball out to the back line (if you can do so without glitches of course), run across your entire team (in front or behind, because, you know, it's not like that's a penalty or anything... Oh wait), cut inside on the opponent's forwards, and you have yourself a try!Every.Single.Time.How about rucks?Guess what?You'll win every single one of them.Don't fret if the game glitches out and you lose possession.At least 1/3 of the time, you'll overturn the ball in a defensive ruck.You just need to get used to the horribly mapped out controls.Now, as long as the gameplay is decent--which it is not--then I think games can get a pass for bad commentary.But hey, everything is bad, so why not bring that up too?Get ready for repetition, because nearly every time you get the ball, you'll hear, "chance to get it wide maybe?"Because, you know, that's the only play there is in rugby.However, you likely will not have a chance to get it wide without some kind of glitch or inadvertent button press due to the poorly mapped controls and ultimately lose possession.Ah, penalties.I touched on this briefly earlier, but for the most part, they just have a mind of their own.Many penalties appear to just not be included at all, like obstruction, and when penalties are called, they generally leave you saying, "wait...what?"Every once and a while offsides gets called on you, just for good measure, not because someone is offsides.Also, if you don't perform well in a ruck, you'll often get called for hands in.Brilliant development in my opinion.Over model penalties that the game gives you NO control over, like hands in, and make penalties that you have complete control over, like obstruction, non existent.Overall, this game is just horrible, and I'm sorry I wasted my money on it.As another review site put it perfectly, it is a complete clusterruck.Please, don't buy this game despite the reviews because there are no other modern rugby games like I did, it will just make you sad.1.0 out of 5 starsDo NOT buy this!This game is unrealistic and is really frustrating.There is no online play, etc.I am very very sorry I spent my money on this game because if is full of ****1.0 out of 5 starsDon't even think about buying this game.I thoroughly love the sport of rugby.Few things have ever had the ability to make me as happy as rugby does.I also enjoy gaming.Hopefully, whenever EA decides to take the reigns and makes a solid rugby game for us rugger/gamers, we will have something to look forward to.This is, honestly, the most poorly developed game I think I have ever seen.Constant bugs from errant passes and constant offsides penalties, horribly player and ESPECIALLY ball movements, horrendous button layout, terrible "commentating", and a lack of plays combined with horrible AI makes this nowhere near being even remotely close to rugby.1.0 out of 5 starsThis game can't be THAT bad.After allI read the other reviews on here, and thought "you know what?This game can't be THAT bad.After all, HB Studios made this game, and they have a long history of making Rugby games."You would never guess that this developer had made another game, let alone a rugby game.The graphics in this game are a slight improvement over those in Rugby World Cup 2011.Which was on the Xbox 360.The animations are somehow worse.The game only slightly resembles Rugby, and it lacks any sort of strategy.Its really a bummer that this is the only Rugby game available on consoles.I would recommend playing any of the Rugby Nations games on your cell phone over this.1.0 out of 5 starsOne StarVery poor and very basic.A waste of my money.5.0 out of 5 starsGreat book for those new to the gameI know a bit about cricket but needed a lot of help to set up a casual game among friends.This book made it easy to measure out and mark the critical areas of the field (i.e., the creases, wicket placement and height).It also presents the rules in an easy to read way.More advanced subject matter, such as game strategy, team selection, qualities of individual fields, captaining a team, umpiring, etc.are included for those who are more familiar with the game and want to hone their skills.There is even a neat chapter on history and famous rivalries.A great book, especially for beginners!5.0 out of 5 starsExcelent(e)!It's very embarassous a need for writing in english.I'm a brazilian cricket lover and I dislike this obrigation, because my english writing is very bad.However, this book is lovely.Didatic, easily to read and very complete.For a cricket fan, this is a fundamental book.4.0 out of 5 starsWill answer your questionsI am trying to understand and comprehend the rules and regs of this game.I love the, "Dummies", books because they are so good at explanations that require a lot of description.I'm still confused, however I discovered that on YouTube you can watch cricket games and, therefore, try and follow some of them.It's an amazing game; that is for certain.3.0 out of 5 stars... informative but I think it could have been edited better, grammatically and structurallyVery informative but I think it could have been edited better, grammatically and structurally.It's a good read but the mention and then later definition of some information seems misplaced.5.0 out of 5 starsJust enough informationPerfect for an American trying to understand cricket.2.0 out of 5 starsVery disapointed with Virtua Tennis 4Well, I got this game to play with kinect, I research a lot over the internet and I did not find much about it.Anyway, as it does not have demo version I got it on demand.As soon as I downloded it I figure it out that the game is for playing with control and it has one option to play with kinect, so I got so disapointed because I dont want to play with control, I wanted a game 100% kinect and not 10% kinect.I have played a lot Grand Slan tennis on the Wii and I can say that is much better.Conclusion, If you want a kinect game tennis dont buy this Virtua tennis 4.3.0 out of 5 starsKinect performance could have been betterI purchased this one since it has a kinect game mode.It is not perfect in kinect mode as i expected.Sometimes it recognizes your timing and speed very well, sometimes it does not even if you do exactly the same as before.It is a good start.I have not tested the game in regular mode yet.2.0 out of 5 starsPoor Kinect useI bought this game thinking it could be great to play a world tour using Kinect, but you can not use Kinect for games other tna exhibition games or mini games.5.0 out of 5 stars5 stars all the way!I have been playing with a variety of Xbox Kinect games and this is one of the best.I'm amazed at how well it tracks your movements and registers your topspin and other subtleties.You can move up and down the court with relative ease and hit hard if you feel like it.I pop this in when I want to have some after work fun for a while and it never disappoints.Totally worth the money.Have fun!4.0 out of 5 starsHere is ALL you need to know...You CAN FINALLY PLAY DOUBLES online, with a friend as a teammate, at SEPERATE HOUSES on SEPERATE xbox's .Isn't that what we've all been waiting for???YES, i think so.So the game is "arcade like" and maybe not the best tennis game ever, but playing with a friend / doubles / online makes it AWESOME.....period.1.0 out of 5 starsNot worth it even if it were free.While there have been several average to good Star Trek ganes (some of best were the Starfleet Command series, Klingon Academy and some of the adventure games) there have been lots of bad games that have that have milked the Star Trek license.However, even many of the bad games at least tried to be at least somewhat star-trek like.This game is nothing but a pretty bad arcade game that tacks on the starship enterprise as the players vehicle.Neither fun nor at least vaguely star trek like.Avoid.1.0 out of 5 starsAVOIDThis game is a complete DOG.Steam won't install properly without turning off my firewall.Game play (single player) is choppy and the screen is so tight that by the time you spot an attacker you can't get the jumpy reticle in position to fire before you're hit.There appears to be no way to adjust gaphics settings to improve response or to adjust the AI to allow for the poor control.A waste of money, spend your dollars elswhere.1.0 out of 5 starsPure CrapUnless you really love '80s style arcade games, this title is a waste.I got it as a $[...] download, figuring how bad can it be?Through the years some of my favorite games were found in the "bargain bin".What a complete disappointment.I gave it two stars for "fun" because the graphics are actually very good, but the game is just lame to the core.One star is generous.1.0 out of 5 starsI didn't check the Amazon reviews!!!!!Earlier in life i never checked reviews.While I'm not as devoted to the practice of checking reviews as my more intelligent wife, I've gotten much better.This time, however, all I saw was Star Trek and the low price (HINT NUMBER ONE) I purchased it for the XBOX, without reading a single review.Ladies and gentleman, I didn't even look at the stars right under the title (HUGE HINT NUMBER TWO).My only excuse is that I was dying in the desert for a new and PLAYABLE Star Trek game That, "Oh, I don't know, might actually take pride in their work or at least their reputation.This is the worse Star Trek game in the history of the genre.I say this as someone who played ST Armada, but I didn't buy it!I believe Gene Roddenbury is still spinning in his grave and on orbit after this fiasco's release date.I haven't been this upset since Rick Burman and Majel Barrett Roddenbury destroyed what was supposed to be the next Star Trek series.Don't buy, play or acknowledge this game ever!I will keep it as a reminder to check reviews and of a bone-headed mistake.Doesn't even deserve one star!1.0 out of 5 starsWaste of money and not worthy of the name Star TrekI love Star Trek and was really excited to hear about this game.My gf knew this and picked this up in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart for me.I installed it, TRIED to play it for an hour, uninstalled it and have never gone back to it.The graphics are ok.But the controls are too hard to use.Unless you are a die hard gamer and have access to a good usb joystick this game blows chunks.Also there is no plot as I thought there might be.It's Star Trek after all.No, it's just a shoot this, shoot that before you get shot kind of game.Very boring.Don't waste your hard earned $$ on this one folks.5.0 out of 5 starsI buy these for my 88 year old mother!I cannot be the world's best consumer of these tennis balls, but let me tell you this.I buy them regularly for my 88-year-old mother, who uses them on the legs of her little walker to slide easily over floors and carpet... One would never imagine how many kind folk notice her pink tennis balls and compliment her.Mom is a breast cancer survivor, and one of my very best friends is fighting it now...So every praise possible to those who search for more treatments ----or race, walk, or "trundle" for a cure.Great seller and a product we appreciate.4.0 out of 5 starsPink powerI am very pleased- more felt on tennis ball means a better bounce- when more players are on court and have green tennis balls it helps to have pink- cuts down on confusion.5.0 out of 5 starsEasy to find your balls...My daughter loves these balls, they are very cute and highly visible.But for me, the single best thing about these balls is that they are very easy to find on shared tennis courts when it's time to pack up and go!5.0 out of 5 starsHuge fan of pink tennis balls!They're the best because no one (or hardly anyone else has them).When I play with my 9 year old son, easy to tells which balls are ours in the other court!Good to support the fight against breast cancer as well.4.0 out of 5 starsPink Tennis ballsThese balls weren't for me I gave them to a girl who plays tennis as a gift.So nice gift idea but beware not all tennis girls are girly enough to appreciate Pink Balls.Other than that they make an ok collectible item since tennis balls get lost so easily you may not want loose these since they're sort of rare.The package was sealed and the balls are in great condition and just as bouncy and sturdy as regular green balls.I'm not sure about the price since I don't buy Tennis balls but I'm sure it may be better to get them in bulk order if you're a regular player.Thanks for reading.1.0 out of 5 starsStay away from this one..Poor quality... Hard and heavy like rock.. After few overs even the shape changes..Dangerously bad as it might break your bat.Stay away form this one.4.0 out of 5 starsFour StarsGood but they get worn out fast1.0 out of 5 starsPoor quality.Bounces too much on hard surface which ...Poor quality.Bounces too much on hard surface which makes it difficult to play.We have been using this ball for a long time now and this is the first batch that wasn't up to the expectation.5.0 out of 5 starsFive StarsGood1.0 out of 5 starsVery lite and easiely broken with just 6 balls being bowled...I hate this product and highly recommend not to use this.Please do not buy this.Its waste of money.5.0 out of 5 starsGreat practice ballsI only play cricket among friends and we don't want to buy the padding needed when using a real cricket ball.These practice balls are great for friendly games as they are not as hard as real leather cricket balls, but not as soft/light as tennis balls.We played twice for several hours at a time with a six pack and none show signs of breakage yet.5.0 out of 5 starsGreat cricket ballIt was a great cricket ball.I am using this ball for 4 weeks and played lots of game.There is no wear and tear on the ball.It is a great ball.4.0 out of 5 starsGood for T20 matchesThis is a good heavy tennis ball for tennis ball cricket.We play T20 weekly and the ball lasts a whole match.Thereafter, we use it for practice sessions.5.0 out of 5 starsPerfect hard tennis balls!As mentioned these are hard tennis balls for cricket.We use these regularly.One set is good for 3-4 months of weekend games.5.0 out of 5 starsgood jobgood costumer service i like deliveru should keep bat cricket kit that included everything also the hard ball thanks again5.0 out of 5 starsThank you Sachin !!Finished reading Sachins autobiography today.There were a couple of reasons why I was looking forward to reading this book (apart from the fact that I am a die-hard Sachin fan!!)First, I wanted to understand how he was such a perfect player, what made him what he was.The answer to this, after reading the book is something which will sound like a clich, & it is Focused Hard work.Once he had set a goal Sachin was completely focused on achieving it & doing whatever he has to, to get there.To give an example, at one point his training schedule was as follows: 7:30-10:30am .... Batting practice in the nets 11:30 to 4:30pm ....Practice match 5:30 to 8:30pm .... Batting practice in the nets Reminds me of what Malcolm Gladwell said in his book "Outliers" "You need 10000 hours of practice to master a skill".Well, Sachin practiced for much more than that.His dedication to the game was almost on the verge of insanity.On one occasion he reached home in Mumbai after a tour to New Zealand at 6:00am & was already at Wankhede for Mumbais Ranji Trophy match at 8:00am.His focused hard-work played a crucial role in him reaching where he did.Secondly, I wanted to find out what kept him so grounded?How can anyone who has achieved what he has, stay so humble?Sachin is almost revered like a God in India & yet he managed to stay humble.How did he do that?The answer to this question is his family & in particular his father.Sachin quotes his father telling him very early on his carrier that You might play cricket for 20-25 years but remember you will have a much bigger life beyond cricket, so strive to be a good cricketer but make sure you strive harder to be a better person Its these values that his family inculcated in him at a very early age that kept Sachin so humble & down-to-earth.In his typical fashion Sachin has skirted controversies, for e.g.he has not gone into any details about the match fixing saga involving Azhar or the IPL match fixing but there are more than a few strong incidences he has brought up.His views on the Chappell brothers, the declaration of Multan by Rahul Dravid when he was batting on 194 & the ball tampering saga in South-Africa.This book also has details of a lot of funny & embarrassing incidences surrounding Sachin & the Indian team dressing room.It will bring out a lot of chuckles from you.The on-tour struggles of the Indian team specially out of the sub-continent both on & off the field will make us appreciate the team in a whole new light.As I was reaching the end of the book, I was feeling the same thing I felt when Sachin had announced his retirement, a feeling of emptiness.The chapter on the World Cup win & his last test match drew me to tears several times.Its amazing what Sachin has done for the game & for our country.Records are meant to be broken, Sachins records will also be broken but I am very sure we will never see another Sachin !!1.0 out of 5 starsVery disappointing autobiography - a missed opportunityI am a big fan of Tendulkar as are a billion indians!The man is uncontroversial and takes great pains to stay away from revealing anything that is not already publicly known in about 450 pages of dense text.Other than the first 30-40 pages describing his childhood and the events leading to his wedding with Anjali, there is nothing of note here.For example he steers completely clear of the most infamous match fixing scandal involving a former Indian Captain devoting 2-3 lines to it.Nor does he say anything about the falling out with his once schoolmate, Vinod Kambli.The book reads like a chronological account of 24 years of Indian cricket, match by match, series by series interspersed with his own fights with injury (he took over a 100 injections in his career!).The only juicy pieces are what transpired after Dravid declared in Pakistan with Sachin stranded at 194 not out - Sanjay Manjrekar gets a lashing in one paragraph; and the extreme criticism of the Chappell brothers.If a devotee of Sachin's like me was disappointed, that tells you volumes about the book.2.0 out of 5 starsUnderwhelming and Under CookedProbably one could say that as during his cricketing career we fans expect the same perfection from his autobiography as well.24 years of intense media and public scrutiny with every tiny detail being nitpicked and discussed, there wasn't a lot unsaid which hadn't been written about or known to fans over these years.The autobiography is over loaded with facts and statistics, to the point where one simply wants to skip through chapters and pages.Despite all the hype, the book does not dwell on all the major controversies and issues which affected his career and playing era.Most importantly the match fixing issue of 2000, has been accorded a few customary lines.Hansie Cronje, Azhar and Manoj Prabhaker are all footnotes in a seemingly simplified version of events.In all walks of life especially when it comes to autobiographies of sportspersons, it is the norm to express the opinions and views which were always shackled by rules and codes of conduct earlier.Sunny Days has to be the best cricket autobiography I have read, it had honesty as well as incisiveness which is missing in "Playing it My Way".Too many pages have been devoted to score lines and match summaries.One has a sense of void after completing the book.This is in stark contrast to the sense of fulfillment countless Indian cricket fans including me, experienced after a Sachin Tendulkar ton.5.0 out of 5 starsAn awesome perspective !This was a priceless experience..I wished the book didn't end.It was really refreshing to see things from Sachin's perspective.The only time I saw him live in a stadium finds a mention in his book as well, which was a pleasant surprise!His child like enthusiasm for the game was plain to see on that day and throughout his career.This same enthusiasm is reflected right through the book as well.I enjoyed all of the anecdotes shared, most of which weren't public knowledge.This is a must read for a Sachin fan.Even if you're not a fan of him or the game, it's still worth picking up to get an idea of literally the blood, sweat and tears that made up a legendary career.Life really begins now for you sir, wish you all the best!4.0 out of 5 starsThe rest of the book though interesting since it is said in the great man's own wordsThe most interesting parts of the book are about Sachin's pre-international career days, and about the challenges he faced with multiple injuries.Its also interesting to see how he managed such a prolonged career despite those injuries.The rest of the book though interesting since it is said in the great man's own words, but it is not extra-ordinary.I did not find as many earlier unknown anecdotes as I expected in the book.Also something I felt is not balanced well in the book is that there are several incidents in the book where umpiring decisions had left Sachin feeling hard done by, however don't think there is a single incident in the book where he revealed that he was at the fortunate end of close or wrong decisions.4.0 out of 5 starsFIFA 16: A Futbol Fan's ReviewHi, all.FIFA 16 is yet another addition to the long list of the successful soccer simulation franchise.While some may argue that the game has had little to no innovation in it's last couple of releases (especially since the dawn of the PS4/XBone era), I for one have enjoyed this version a lot, and here's why: I haven't owned a FIFA since FIFA 14 on both PSVita and PS3.While I enjoyed the PSVita a lot (OP finesse shots XD), the PS3 version left me with a bad taste in my mouth.I couldn't run any good plays since the attacking AI of my teammates was nothing short of complete stupidity.The game didn't feel REAL, the player's moves and decisions didn't feel genuine.I didn't own FIFA 15, but I did have the demo on my PS3 and I played it a lot with my friends on Xbox 360.While EA did improve the decision making of the teams, it also completely derailed the realism of passes (a never ending array of perfectly executed first touch passes is just NOT REAL, people).Anyway, it was a step in the right direction and a great version for gamers who just wanted to play an arcade type soccer game.Now, FIFA 16 has changed the way the game is played.Not completely, but there are some blatantly noticeable changes to the gameplay, for better or for worse (depends on who you ask).After trying out the demo, I was kind of skeptical about getting FIFA 16 because the passing had been, in first impressions, gimped.No more first touch passing galore.It threw me off at first because I was used to just pressing X and expect the passes to always get to my teammates, but that wasn't present in 16.Also, the dominance of the aerial through ball, especially in a counterattack, was gone.The pace had been slowed down a lot, and the defensive AI was now WAY smarter than before.I didn't know if I was amazed or appalled at this.But I went ahead and got myself a copy as a self birthday gift (never forget yourself on your birthday, folks).To my satisfaction, the passing had become way more forgiving than in the demo, but it had its learning curve still.When passing, you never want to have your back towards the teammate you're passing to, you always wanna be facing him.Also, you'll want to learn to measure the distance between the passer and the receiver.If the receiver is close, a normal X pass will suffice.If the player is far, now, you'll want to press and hold R1 AND THEN press X.This will make a driven pass to a faraway teammate and is key to keeping possession or to change wings.It also works as a straight ground cross when you're hoarding your opponent's area.Crosses are a bit sharper, but I'd only use them as a last resort or to go for a corner.They're no longer a sure fire way to score.Again, defensive AI is very smart now, so gone are the days of hefty scoreboards.The game is more mental, now.You actually have to plan and really pick out your passes to make an effective attack.It's tough at first, but eventually you'll do it subconsciously.The cons?Well, it may not be the soccer game for everyone.I hear PES 2016 is more arcade-y and that can cater to those types of players.Also, in the PS3 version, I've been having trouble connecting to Online matches and when I do connect, I get pretty bad lag.Also, some pretty good leagues are missing, aside from the very weird absence of the Brazilian League (what was THAT, EA?)So, in conclusion: PROS - New gameplay system: Welcomes new players and makes old ones have to relearn the game, but with good dividends (it's up to you if you want to keep enjoying FIFA by crossing a new, small learning curve.)- Female national teams (Women kicking some balls.Yippie-kay-yay!)- FUT Draft: A new way to play Ultimate Team.CONS - No Brazilian League.- May not be the soccer game for everyone.PES has REALLY caught up this year.- Still missing many great leagues (Uruguay, Paraguay, Ukraine, maybe add some more Asian flavor to the mix) For me, deserving of its 4 stars.Thank you all for reading!1.0 out of 5 starsYet another EA scanCan't believe I let EA swindle me out of money again.I knew I should have checked it beforehand , but i was silly enough to assume new career mode features would be present in current gen.Sadly I wad mistaken, Fifa 16 for ps3is nothing more than fifa 15 with a different menu color.Don't buy.3.0 out of 5 starssame thingPretty much the same as Fifa 14.EA has a great scam going with their games.The release a new title every year and it's basically the same game.I should have waited another year or two.1.0 out of 5 starsSame as fifa 15 on PS3I noticed only 2 changes in fifa 16 on PS3: gameplay difficulty & the music.Everything else is same as fifa 15 which is deceptive to say the least.No changes in career mode, no online lobbies.First fifa game I returned!!Buy only the ps4 version!1.0 out of 5 starsGreat Customer RelationsI wanted to thank EA Sports for cutting off the PS3 users of FIFA 16 now for 3 days.Some lie put on the screen stating that "due to the volume of users people cannot log in to Ultimate Team".TELL THE TRUTH!!!!LET US HAVE SOME IDEA OF WHEN WE CAN PLAY.ANY REFUNDS HEADED OUR WAY BECAUSE WE PAID OUT MONEY TO PLAY THIS GAME AND NOW YOU HAVE CUT US OFF.Great Customer Relations.Keep the customers in the dark.WOW!And while I am at it, what the heck happened to the graphics on the PS3 version.Reminds me a bit of games from the early days of gaming.Remember Space Invaders?OMG.Get your act together, EA Sports.5.0 out of 5 starsPlay for a while before you review please.This is the best 2k game to date.Really confused by the negative reviews.Runs fantastic on my machine (Lenovo y410p gaming laptop).For the review that said the colors were off.You probably need to update or upgrade your graphics card.I had the same issue and was Pissed!For a minute.Only two knocks on this game: 1.So much time spent loading.2.Only 2 options to answer people in career mode.1 answer makes you sound like a panzy and the other like a moron.You choose your destiny.Lol Only took me 6 hours to download by the way.When the download starts it says it will take 13.It most definitely will not.Love this game!2.0 out of 5 starsPeople complaining about downloading it should be complaining about the game itselfConsidering that 1.5 hours of my playtime was spent attempting to play a single player portion of the game lets just say I'm not a very happy customer.2K is one of the biggest game companies in the world and can't seem to be able to stress test their game's servers/not hide BS DRM in a game with this always online bullcrap.You know how to decrease stress on your servers, don't make the most popular mode (myCareer) always online like s.Also stop defending that it's multiplayer game, this isn't Warcraft, there are like max 10 players at a time.Onto the actual game: Only played myCareer a few hours after release the game is fun, looks good, isn't really as responsive as I'd like, players feel a little heavy (Video game me should be able to react on defense better than real me) I'm not asking to be Scotty Pippin immediately but I can't even attempt to recover to at least contest a layup that would go in but look a little more realistic having someone there.It's kind of tough to get assists as a rookie on HOF difficulty but I'll figure it out.I didn't read up on this game too much before I got it because I did that last year then PC got jipped on features that really sounded cool to me.So I was really surprised to find out that I'm best friends with Andre Drummond and he can talk to me, which IS awesome.It would be more awesome if the voice acting was a little better and not so stone faced like Skyrim was.Speaking of Skyrim!The game takes up 50GB which is like 8 Skyrims.Edit: This is almost worse than I thought.Instead of making the AI smarter on harder difficulties they just make your character artificially slower which is stupid.Steve Kerr is an announcer, Stan Van Gundy's guy looks like the penguin from batman.Passing is not working right or is just made more difficult by the previously mentioned crap with difficulty level I can't tell.Myteam still doesn't work, neither does the park, or anything else online as far as I can tell.Javale McGee and Dwight Howard doing turnaround fadeaway jumpshots from 13ft out?Yup!You betcha.Invisible players interviewing with Doris, yup.Also since when does EVERY player in the NBA shoot jumpshots from 5ft out instead of a wide open layup?Oh yeah even when I do get a teammate the ball around the bucket wide open, does he brick the layup 85% of the time?I don't know why this is.Probably something to do with the difficulty level forcing me to be 80pt Kobe just to win a MyCareer game.BTW all of this stuff is from myCareer because it's the only thing working so far.Edit 2: Add Joakim Noah to the list of bigs doing turnaround fadeaway jumpers.The game seems to just want you to score 40 pts have 15 rbs and 15 asts to get a win in my career.I'm gonna turn the difficulty down to test this theory because my guys miss WIDE open transition layups all the time.The opposing teams big no matter how bad will alway get like 7 offensive rebounds and convert them almost 100% of the time.If one of the players on myPlayer's team blocks a shot the computer gets it back no matter what.Usually with a wide open layup.My team mates will not jump to block a shot after the opposing PG flies by me.But when I beat an opposing PG literally every defender jumps on me dog pile style.myPark is fun until you run into the 99ovr guy who is 99ovr on the damned 3rd day of the game being out (and playable) So that's pay to win, pointless.The entire game is designed to make you feel like you have to spend money to get VC to play well in myCareer, get cards in myTeam, do well in myPark presumably to do well in myGM.This appears to be a pretty dead eyed version of candy crush in terms of trying to get people to spend extra money on an already 70 dollar game.Also the sound keeps fading in and out which is really annoying.2.0 out of 5 starsONE Word - SLOW !Lags terribly with the lowest settings on a decent PC !I've got an HP PC: Intel i5 3220M (2.6 GHZ, 4 CPUs), 6 GB Ram (with 5.88 usable), AMD Radeon 7650M 2GB Video Card.I used to run 2k14 very smooth, without any lagging.Unfortunately, I can only say the complete opposite about the 2k15 !!The game runs smooth only in freestyle mode and almost smooth in blacktop mode, but other than that in every mode (Mycareer, Quick matches, Mypark etc) it laggs noticeably even in the lowest settings !!!!!!!This is terrible.I've been playing NBA 2K after the 2K9 version so i've got a lot of experience with this game !I'm really dissapointed with this and when I searched for the same problem on the 2k forums there are plenty of people like me who have decent PCs but are unable to play 2k15 without lagging !!!!!BAD, bad, bad.....1.0 out of 5 starsDon't trust themI figured since this is sold by 2k itself that I could expect a working product; instead, I get one with a product code that has already been redeemed.I guess it's back to EA.3.0 out of 5 starsnot exactly what was expectedWas expecting it to be a physical disk...turned out to be a digital download...also the packaging was incredibly difficult to open4.0 out of 5 starsgood paddle for beginnersi bought this paddle for my brother who is 13. he likes it a lot especially because it is different than most black and red paddles.the rubber is pretty good and the glue used is pretty good as well.it does a decent job at generating spin and is effective at smashes.it is a light paddle.i am a competative player and i think this paddle is very good, although i would only recommend it for beginners and those who are developing skills.5.0 out of 5 starsThe perfect paddle.I'm no expert by far, but this paddle is great.I ordered it to play with my friends at our common room.I was worried at first if it was a good paddle, but it ended up being perfect.If you are a beginner this paddle is perfect.I do not pay attention to the stat numbers like control 10, spin 5.5, speed 6.5.I'm a beginner player in ping pong, and I'm able to hit great with this paddle.The control spin and speed are all perfect to me.I recommend this paddle :).5.0 out of 5 starsNiceI set up a ping pong table at church for the youth to use and I grew very disappointed with the cheap paddles I bought that peeled apart after moderate use I decided to spend a few bucks on a better paddle for myself.I'm by no means a pro, shoot I'm lucky if I beat a 12 year old (I'm 32), but I can tell that this paddle puts spin where I've never spun before.I used to laugh when the kids would talk about improving their game by putting spin on the ball because I never saw any difference but with this paddle I can definitely tell the difference!It doesn't make me want to go out and buy a $90 dollar paddle but I'm very pleased with this one.5.0 out of 5 starsWill change the gameThis paddle really has it's mass affect on your opponent.It just takes a day or 2 to get used to especially when you went from a plain hard surface to this one.Overall very good paddle.5.0 out of 5 starsGreat beginner paddle with decent spin and control.I entered my freshman year of college with no ping pong experience and my skill level reflected this.I started off with the terrible cheap,plastic paddles and zero star balls.I always thought "the paddle and balls doesn't make you good, you're either good or bad at the game", but after purchasing this paddle I immediately saw a huge difference.I went from a filthy casual to one of the better players at my university- not top 10 tier, but I went from being decimated 0-7 (white washed) in 1 minute to actually sustaining lengthy volleys,returning smashes, sending smashes, and winning a few games against those much better than me.My time is up with this paddle; I'm moving upwards with equipment and purchasing a custom bat that's around 5x the cost.However, I would recommend this as a great way to develop technique, learn how spin affects the game, and dazzle some people with its unusual color.Regulation paddles must be red and black, but while playing more friendly stuff this is fun to show off.3.0 out of 5 starsPadded but why zippered at head?This is a nice padded table tennis paddle/racket cover.My only complaint is the zipped being placed at the head.I have to grip the rubber to pull out the paddle.This puts oil on the rubber and diminishes the tackiness of the rubber (which is what adds to the spin and control).So, a 1 for the zipper at the top and a 4 for the padding and apparent quality of the cover.I just averaged this out to a total score of 3.2.0 out of 5 starsGood Quality but Poor DesignSUMMARY: Minus 4-stars for placing the zipper on the top instead of on the side.Deal breaker.Minus 1-star for listing the case as designed for 2 paddles when only 1 paddle will fit.Plus 2-stars for good build quality DETAIL: I just had to throw away two perfectly good paddles recently because the rubber faces completely lost their tack.That was my fault because I never kept them in a case.So, I had to go out and buy two new paddles, but this time I bought two cases to protect them.Unfortunately, I have to go with 2-stars on this case and I'll tell you why.First, in general, this is a very good quality case.If you have an inexpensive paddle, are not concerned with having to grab the paddle by its face in order to remove it.this case will be a good choice.Made with a heavy canvas type material; it's padded just enough and not too much; the zipper is good quality.Even the styling is good.(The case is black w/yellow not black w/orange as pictured if that's important to you.)The problem with this case has nothing to do with the materials used or with the finishing.The good quality finishing is the only reason I give this case 2-stars instead of 1.The problem is with the functional design.Because the zipper was placed on the top rather than on the side, you'll need to grab your paddle by its tacky rubber face every time you want to remove your paddle from the case, The oils from your fingers will eventually destroy the tackiness of the paddle.Hard to understand that design choice.Why not place the zipper on the side so the case opens like a book, allowing you to remove the paddle by its handle instead of it's face?I see a couple of cases by Butterfly that do open from the side instead of the top and I most likely will give them a try.I would also make another point for anybody hoping to use this case with two rackets.The description states that this case "Can Hold 1-2 Rackets".No way.It fits one racket perfectly, but if you're looking for a case to fit two rackets, I would suggest you look elsewhere.As you can see from other reviews, it's frustrating to buyers that the manufacturer states in the description that it will fit two rackets, especially given that other reviewers have pointed out otherwise.Plus, it is clearly not designed for two rackets.Aside from the fact that it's just too small for two rackets, if it were designed for two rackets there would at least be a fabric divider inside.This case is designed for (1) racket, not (2).Funny thing is that I usually read reviews before purchasing and several other people mentioned both of these issues.Anyway, I bought two of these and while I really don't need a case for them, I'm going to keep these cases for the cheapie paddles I keep around for kids and parties, but I'm going to purchase something that opens along the side rather than along the top for my good paddles.5.0 out of 5 starsThe Middle is YELLOW - thought you should knowVery nice product.Well made.The size is appropriate.The workmanship is top notch.But the picture here on Amazon looks like the middle section is kind of orange right?Nah, it's as yellow as yellow can be.It doesn't affect my satisfaction with the product, but I just thought it would have been nice to know before I bought it.5.0 out of 5 starsDoes its job...Enough said.... does its job, keeps your paddle fresh and safe from harm, I carry my paddle around in my backpack as you never know when you have to fight to the death in a game of table tennis.3.0 out of 5 starsbut the stupid placement of the zipper requires you to touch the ...You can fit a ball in, but the stupid placement of the zipper requires you to touch the face of the paddles to get it out.Why?The zipper could just have easily been put on the side instead of the top.5.0 out of 5 starsBeer Pong,It's the New SolitaireThis is a cool little unit to help a person get used to hitting a ping pong ball.It holds about twelve ping pong balls in a gravity feed and launches them in a nice slow arc.It requites four AA batteries.They call it a Robot,.it doesn't move.It doesn't talk.It just plays beer pong with you.This is what robots do.This is the future.Seriously though, it's a fun unit.3.0 out of 5 starsConsider yourself served: A very simple table tennis server, really only suitable for early beginnersPROS: Simple Most inexpensive unit of this type available Easy to set up and use Relatively compact for this kind of unit Relatively sturdy Good for an early beginner Works smoothly Holds about 23 ping-pong balls Battery operated--do not have to move the table close to an outlet CONS: Really only suitable for early beginners Not adjustable--same lob every time Single angle Single speed No spin on the ball No delay with the first lob Ping-pong balls not included The Joola iPong Mini Portable Solo Table Tennis Server is about the simplest and one of the least expensive tablet tennis robot that you could buy.You basically fill it up with ping-pong balls, flip the switch to the on position, and away you go.That's it.The problem is that it basically lobs about one ball every two seconds at a fixed interval the exact same way, every time and there is no variability.The iPong is packed alone in its box and is made out of a translucent, tea-brown colored plastic.If memory serves me correctly, the shape is basically a hyperboloid (oh, it's been a long time since geometry)--basically a cylinder with concave sides.It is open at the top where you can see the corkscrew-shaped ball feed and there is a hole in the front where the ball comes out.There is an on off switch on the back and a battery compartment at the bottom.The unit requires 4 AA batteries to operate.I really did like this, as it means you don't have to move your table in proximity to an outlet and there is no extension cord to trip over.You will need a small screw driver to undue the battery compartment.You will also need 20 table tennis balls (23, really, if you want to fill the unit completely).I understand why the thing didn't come with batteries--batteries are heavy and can corrode.But with an MSRP of about $50 dollars, I don't understand why it didn't come with ping-pong balls.Sure, 20 iPong brand ping-pong balls will set you back by about $10 on Amazon today, but there is no way that it actually costs iPong 50 cents per ball.Generously, it would probably cost a couple dollars per unit to prepack it filled with practice level ping-pong balls, given that they manufacture the things, and it would greatly increase customer satisfaction because you could use the iPong out of the box.Whatever.I plunked down the extra 10 bucks and bought me some Joola iPong Seamless Poly Pro, 3-star, table tennis balls on Amazon and waited two days for them to ship.The unit is mostly made of hard plastic, it is plenty sturdy, and sits firmly on the table.It is well grounded and doesn't wobble or pitch as it throws ping-pong balls.It may not be heirloom quality stuff and given the heavy plastic construction, I don't know that it would survive even a single drop to the floor, but it is plenty solid to do the job and is the least expensive table tennis robot that you can buy.Set up is simple.Just set the device on the table, flip the switch, and let her rip.It takes a second to adjust the angle so it sends the ball just where you want it.That's it.The problem, as stated above, is that the ball is simply lobbed in the same direction, at the same rate, at the same angle, and with the same arc each and every time.For a beginner, this isn't a problem.It will definitely teach them to hit a ball and by changing the position of the iPong on the table, you can make it come from front and center, right, or left.But you can't add spin to the ball, there's no change in ball speed, or even a slight change in a directionality.It's just bang, bang, bang every two seconds until the balls run out.That said, there isn't even a delay before the first ball is lobbed.That means you either have a friend turn on the iPong, or you miss a few balls as you scurry to the other side of the table.It would have been nice for them to put in a delay of about 10 seconds before the first ball is thrown.The item works well and, I suppose, does what it is supposed to do.If you are looking for a very simple table tennis trainer for someone who is just beginning, this may be the one you are looking for.But if you are looking for a table tennis robot that can challenge a more advanced player or one that will grow with your level of skill--one that can add spin, change the speed, change the angle--this is not for you.I can recommend this unit for a beginner but that's about it.For someone who already knows how to do a very basic volley, it won't be of much use.For everyone else, you will have to invest in a more expensive model.4.0 out of 5 starsThe iPong table tennis trainer is perfect for the casual or up and coming table tennis players ...The Joola iPong is a really interesting table tennis ball feed thats perfect for practice.The first question my husband asked was, Whos going to pick up the balls? Joola also has a few accessories, including a table tennis net that will do just that.Theres no assembly and its ready to roll as soon as four AA batteries are inserted (not included).You will need a Philips head screwdriver to open the battery door, which is on the bottom.The balls are loaded from the top, which is 7 in diameter.Theres no cover so they can simply be dropped in.The plastic is hard and durable, but not scratch- nor scuff-resistant.Mine is already scuffed up around the inside.Its a really interesting table tennis tool to watch, not that anyone is going to practice and watch the balls spiral down at the same time.It is however, easy to see when the iPong needs to be reloaded.I dont have the orange iPong Balls balls, but think these would be much better for practice.The iPong is perfect for the casual or young user.Its not a large trainer and the good thing is that it can go back in the box fully loaded and ready to head to someone elses house.In our case thats what well have to do because we dont have a table.IPONG ACCESSORIES: iPong Table Tennis Net iPong Balls iPong Practice Table Tennis Targets5.0 out of 5 starsVery nice and easy to use, good for most casual to intermediate playersThe Joola IPong Mini Ball Holder is pretty cool.It holds about 20 balls and you will need them.It sends them every couple of seconds or so (says every two seconds, and that seems right.It also looks pretty cool.It is a smokey plastic that lets you see the balls.While its plastic design makes it light, it also allows it to have a pretty cool shape.It does not feel flimsy, and unless it falls off the table, it should last a long time.I like that it runs off of batteries, because it makes it more portable and I don't have to worry about plugging it in.This also makes it easier to position.There is a spiral inside that feeds the balls, it's a nice, simple and efficient design.For the price, it is a good value.If you are a serious player, you might want to get Newgy.This is a basic ball launcher at a very good price.But keep in mind you will go through 30 balls in about a minute.You also do not have the option to set spins (e.g.top spin, back spin, etc).You also cannot set the speed or the ball frequency.But at this price point, this is not a negative.I am just noting it for anyone who might have that question.You would have to spend a lot more to get those features.For the casual player, this is great.You might want to get yourself a ball catch net, which will make ball retrieval so much easier!Joola makes one.4.0 out of 5 starsPretty consistent, inexpensive trainerIf you are like me having a ping-pong table is one of those items (like owning an air hockey table) that seems like a good purchase at first, but eventually turns into a handy place to store boxes and nick-knacks.Often it is not that you don't want to play, but you can't find someone to play with.The inability to practice regularly causes you to end up finding a new hobby.Th iPong Mini is the inexpensive cousin of the iPong Pro.The Mini is a good basic ball launcher that continually feeds up to 20 balls to you every couple of seconds.This is a great ball launcher if all you want is a constant repetitive ball toss.The Mini will send the ball in a soft arc in the same general direction.This allows you to repeatedly respond to the same type of shot.You can angle the launcher, or place it at different spots on the table, to give yourself a greater variety of shots.The speed is slow enough that beginners and kids can enjoy learning to hit the ball.Which inevitably causes your table to be used more often.For the price, this is a great ball launcher.We have not had any issues with it yet.If you want more control over ball speed, spin, and shot randomization you may want the iPong Pro, otherwise this is great.1.0 out of 5 starsI purchased this Viper racket set as it was recommended by Amazon in combination with the Joola Inside Ping ...I purchased this Viper racket set as it was recommended by Amazon in combination with the Joola Inside Ping Pong Table I purchased.After 2 days of playing, the edges around the paddles are already fraying.Also, the adhesive / glue that holds down the paddle surface is also peeling back from the paddles.Overall a very poor quality set and I am very disappointed as a customer.1.0 out of 5 starsDon't expect to play!The paddles are ok but the balls absolutely worthless.I got this set for my husband's surprise party and no one ended up being able to play because the balls were unusable.Extremely disappointed.1.0 out

balls.The paddles seem fine but we need some good round balls.4.0 out of 5 starsOkay for fun!Thin sponge and very light.The balls do not bouce very well but they are cheap and fit my needs.I bet the quality are as good as other cheap sets.4.0 out of 5 starsHandles need to have a finish on them vs. ...Handles need to have a finish on them vs. raw wood.I dipped them in varnish to help keep them cleaner and last longer.5.0 out of 5 starsgreat for the price takes your game up a notch or two!I was tired of the old paddels that came with the table.The winter competition was getting mundane.I bought this kit and it took our little group to a whole new level.I never new what a difference a new softer paddle and ping pong balls with some grip left on them could do for game.This was a great buy for the money I consider it a stepping stone to yet another level of ping pong play.5.0 out of 5 starsGreat affordable paddlesNonexpensive, creates decent spin, good control, and handle fits nicely in the hand.The balls are decent too.Safe buy if you're looking for a decent set of paddles.5.0 out of 5 starsgood for the moneyWe bought an old garage-sale table and what came with it were single layer rubber, pips out.Dead and boring.This set, for the money, is an excellent buy.The paddles are grippy, light and well balanced and have more feel and control than $15 over-the-counter single paddles from the Sports Store.They raised the level of the adults' and kids' playing immediately.Everyone enjoyed the game more.Money well spent.3.0 out of 5 starsdecent paddlesI bought these paddles to go with my new ping pong table.I have enjoyed hours of play with them.Now let me explain the reasoning for my 3 star review.I gave only three stars because first the handles are not the most comfortable things in the world and i have found myself using the paddles that came with the tables for the reason that they are more comfortable.second and this is the second star off the rubber that makes up the face of the paddle has started to peel off, no more than a quarter inch but peeled nonetheless.but on the up side the paddles seem to give excellent control of the ball probably due to the "grippieness" of the rubber that is on the faces of the paddles.i think that if you are a serious ponger then these paddles may be for you but if you are like me and don't keep score you may want to find a paddle with a more comfortable paddle that you will enjoy playing with for longer periods of time.5.0 out of 5 starsRock solid paddlesI've been looking for a set of solid entry level paddles.I'm happy to report that the Stiga Performance paddles are really nice.I purchased these as a Christmas present for my kids.We have been playing with them for about a week now and they are holding up really well.The strike surface is very sticky and allows you to put some heavy spin on the ball.The glue is holding up so far too.The handles feel nice and pretty balanced.I've been really happy so far with my purchase.4.0 out of 5 starsDoes its job!Before purchasing this item I made the proper measurments of my billiard table to make sure the item fit well with a bit of over hang on sides for net.I am so far, remarkably satisfied with this item.It fits comfy on top of table, the stick on cushion buttons protects main table from scratches and significantly removes movement of top table.The item is sturdy and well made for the most part.There are two cons however: 1. some assembly required and the table pieces are heavy.2.There is mild bowing in middle of table because of billiard space, but I fixed that easy by using a 1x1 block of wood under both sides of mid and the table sits perfect after that.All in all I really do like this item and it is a lot better than storing away a full size $300 table.Its sturdy and the table itself is covered in a PVC layer which means it can get a drink or two spilled on it and still last.3.0 out of 5 starsIt's only good for causal play around useBought this to place over my pool table for entertainment use only.Keep in mind, this is much heavier than I thought.I opted to not hinge the pieces together.The pieces are so heavy, I think after a couple of foldings, they'll brake off.I just slide the four pieces together, put a piece of wood in the middle to prevent bowing, and it does the trick.Plus, it makes it easier to put up/take down/and store.If I were to hinge these pieces together, I would definitely need someone else to help put it up and take it down.Also keep in mind, this is not a professional tournament table.It's only good for causal play around use....which is what I wanted.It is okay made but over-priced.If they knocked off 50% off the price, it would be an awesome deal.As it stands, it's okay for fun use.5.0 out of 5 starsMany hours of happiness!Buy this.You won't be sorry.Yes, it is four separate piece, and if you don't place it on a solid table top, it will most likely warp.So don't DO that!But some plywood to put it on to fit over your pool table, Or use it with the styrofoam inserts that you can put in the bed of the pool table to bring it up to an even level.The surface of the ping pong table itself is wonderful.The action is fast play, and smooth.We love playing ping pong on this table.We play simply for the joy of the game, not for competition.For what we use it for its great!3.0 out of 5 starsIts okay for occasional useGood for small kids and occasional play.Good choice for storage if you are tight on space.Needs support (I used some books on my pool table) under the boards otherwise they sag a little.Probably because it is a thinner board, the ball bounces less than the dedicated tables.Since it is a 4 piece set there is a joint in the middle running from one player's end to the other.So the ball obviously jumps around unpredictably if it lands on this joint.4.0 out of 5 starswell lovedBought to cover a pool table and is used for a 9 year old who loves the table.It was very heavy when delivered.Box was a little beat up.Two of the corners of the table were beat up but I put some glue on them to hold them in place.Takes two people to put together and move around.Overall it's a great hit for lots of kid fun.4.0 out of 5 starsFor anyone interested in keeping their paddle maintainedI play for a couple hours every week day with a Carlos Chiu Butterfly paddle.The paddle when new was incredible, the spins and the speed were beyond what any of my opponents have ever seen.As time went on, with constant cleaning using this product, the paddle has remained FAR stickier than any of my opponents more expensive paddles.For a small $20 investment, I would say it's a small price to pay to double the life of your paddle's spin an control, and keep that winning edge ;).4.0 out of 5 starsGreat, almost-needed Racket Care product.Bad value.If you have anything from a mid-range recreational paddle to a high-end professional paddle, you will need to clean your paddle's rubber if you care at all about your investment's efficacy (in applying spin to your shots) lasting.The two components that make up this package are a great way of doing just that.Washing your paddle down with water in a sink to remove the dirt, grease, and oil can only do so much, exactly like how rinsing oily peanut-butter stains from a dining plate with merely water is a lost cause.The foam (which does a massively better job than merely water) comes out of the container explosively quickly, so ration it onto your paddle's surfaces with utmost caution.The sponge is also a well-made utensil in doing the needed scrubbing, in addition to its ability to dry your paddle to some extent.However, the Butterfly Rushawa Table Tennis Racket Care Kit is way overpriced at $21.If you buy the sponge and the foam cleaner separately elsewhere, together the price is $13.50 instead.2.0 out of 5 starsCleaning Sponge Has Fallen Apart Too EasilyIn a nutshell, the soap and dispenser is high quality - but the cleaning sponge is not very durable.For the purpose of cleaning the rubber and maintaining a soft, tacky finish on my paddle - this is a quality care kit.The issue (as shown in attached photos) is that the blue scrubber of the sponge has quickly separated from the yellow which makes it increasingly difficult to clean.I'm actively looking for an alternative cleaning sponge as a result, and given that this is a fairly specific item - that's disappointing.5.0 out of 5 starsCleanliness Next to "Godliness"I have used this cleaner and sponge and have found the combination to be an excellent choice.I have not found any residue as a result of using this cleaner and my rubber paddle surfaces take on a fresh, new appearance.I clean my paddle surfaces after each workout and find this improves my spin-ability, considerably.You will need to keep a plastic covering adhering to the rubber surface to prevent oxidation deterioration of the rubber that can destroy frictional quality needed for good spin.I will be purchasing this item again.I might, however, opt for the cleaner only, as you can substitute make-up sponges when cleaning.I highly recommend this product and I believe it is worth the money.(Some players believe that water, alone, will suffice when cleaning their paddle rubber.We all know, however, that fingerprints contain oil, thus, I have been using this product with the relief that it seems to remove fingerprint oils and all grime that accumulate during play that I don't believe water, alone, can remedy.)By the way, you don't need but about three small drops of the foam on the paddle surface to clean it, as a little goes a long way.Veteran players know not to get any moisture into the sponge or the blade beneath the rubber surface as this can damage your paddle.I have only been using this product for a short time, so I don't know its effects over time, but as of two weeks of use, I'm very pleased.5.0 out of 5 starsWorks well!This product does exactly what you want it to do.It keeps your rubbers clean and sticky!I play about 4 or 5 times a week and I clean my rubbers once a week and the tackiness returns each time to fresh out of the package tacky!4.0 out of 5 starsFun for casual playWe are in no way serious table tennis players, and barely know what the star ratings for ping pong balls mean, but we play a lot on the weekends for fun, with the kids, and these are just fine.They definitely are better than some of really bad thin-as-eggshells-with-no-bounce ones we've seen, and it is kind of fun to watch the patterns spinning after you hit the ball, especially if you try to apply spin with the racket.No complaints at all, but somehow I suspect that a serious player would need a more serious ball.I also assume a serious player wouldn't be interested in balls with sports patterns on them anyway in the first place, so there you go.If you ask my kids, they'd easily give it 5 stars.5.0 out of 5 starsGreat Cat Toys!My kitty, Ziva, is not so hip on the basketball or baseball styled ones, but she goes bonkers over the ones painted to look like soccer balls.A lot cheaper than the expensive cat toys at PetsMart and they get a lot more play time as well!5.0 out of 5 starsA Sure WinnerI ordered these for my kitties.They love to play with them.I've never had a cat yet that didn't like them.I would always recommend these for any cat owner.5.0 out of 5 starsBalls last very well!This is a great pack of table tennis balls.Designs hold up well to repeated use.Balls have been taking a pounding and last very well.5.0 out of 5 starsExactly what my cat neededThese were cute ping pong balls and exactly what my cat needed for a great value.I would recommend them.5.0 out of 5 starsnice ping pong set!great product ...great price and value!3.0 out of 5 starsDidn't live up to the previous reviews.Two of the paddles delaminated quickly as we played ping pong.One had partially came unglued from the package.Hopefully we can reglue the rubber back down!1.0 out of 5 starsFell Apart on Day OneWithin one day of use, one of the paddles starting coming apart.Unacceptable.Very disappointed in this product.5.0 out of 5 starsFive StarsGood quality5.0 out of 5 starsFun and Cute!I received the Ohuhu LED Badminton Shuttlecock Dark Night Glow Birdies Lighting For Outdoor & Indoor Sports Activities, 4-piece from Ohuhu in exchange for an honest review.They are not only cute but super fun!There is a button you can press which changes the ordinary birdie into a fun LED birdie!I just love it!So fun for playing at night or in the dark.They come in a really nice box and are just so unique!I would highly recommend them to anyone!5.0 out of 5 starsLove these!Let us keep playing during dusk!I know that it is a popular idea for family game night.For most families it means playing board games.For my family it is more than just the board games, we love to play Badminton.The only problem with wanting to play Badminton is that now with Autumn upon us, the days are starting to get shorter.I found a solution for the early nights.It is the LED Badminton Shuttlecock.These take playing Badminton to a whole new level.Now we can play at any time of the day.When you want to use these all you need to do is turn on the little switch on the inside of the shuttlecock or birdie as my children have always called them.Once you turn them on they come to life with bright fun colors.There is one that blinks the colors of the rainbow, one red, blue, and green.These are also safe for inside the house, so that means we may just be setting up a net in the basement for playing in the winter with the lights out.We may also try playing outside in the snow with these now that we do not have to worry about losing them in the snow.4.0 out of 5 starsFun, Light Up BadMinton Games!These are totally fun!I received on pack of these LED Badminton Shuttlecocks to review and they are so fun!!We love to get out and play yard games but we don't really have any lighting in the back yard, so once it starts getting dark we have to stop.These LED shuttlecocks create a whole new element to the game!I love them!We love to play around, but we aren't professionals or anything.Rules?What rules?!?!This box contains four shuttlecocks and the only complaint I have is that one of them in my box was dead.I'm not sure if the button somehow got pushed in shipping or if it was just a dead one.I haven't yet tried to take it apart or anything, but I might.The other three work fine so it hasn't really been a problem.These are goose feather with a cork ball head that has terrific bounce and give good return.They are lightweight and easy to handle.These are great for extending the playing time past dark and are a decent value for the fun.I think we're going to be enjoying these for awhile!4.0 out of 5 starsCute and fun!Our kids really enjoy playing badminton; I like it because it's an easy way for them to get some exercise in our backyard.These LED badminton shuttlecocks are super cute and a fun way to liven up the game.This was particularly handy as our eldest son was starting to tire of the game, but this reignited his excitement.There are four shuttlecocks in the box; they are red, green, blue, and color-changing.I like that the shuttlecocks are so light and that they have on/off buttons.They do seem to be made of real feathers, which may be a consideration for anyone who is allergic to feathers as I am.Still, overall, I think that this is a very cute fun product and Im quite pleased with this find.I received this product free to review.Opinions are 100% my own.5.0 out of 5 starsnight time playHow do you make a game of Badminton more fun?How about night time Badminton with some really cool LED Shuttlecocks.Oh Yeah!Super fun for the the whole family.Badminton used to be one of my favorite games to play when friends came over to our house.It was fun that is until sundown came and you couldn't see the shuttlecock anymore.I really like how it came with 4 for some reason I thought I was only going to get one.I must have read it wrong but sure enough there are 4 in a pack, 3 steady lights, and 1 that changes color.Anyone for a game of nighttime badminton?I received this product as part of a promotion in order to facilitate an honest and unbiased review.3.0I purchased this item as a "Add-on Item" for $1 ...I purchased this item as a "Add-on Item" for $1.92.Now it is at $8.15?What a price hike!Anyway it does its job.With some efforts you can inflate a ball to the right pressure.It leaks to some extent so you have to pump fast.Also needle connection is rigid so it is easy to be bent.5.0Best corded headset I have ever owned, without question.A video review of the SteelSeries Siberia V/2 USB-powered headset.One thing I failed to mention: The headeset WILL run without the accompanying software, but you lose some functionality by not using the software.Without it, you cannot adjust the LED settings and you cannot change equalizer settings.5.0Simply incredible.I was expecting a good headset when I bought these.What I was not expecting was to fall in love.Pros: Its fits perfectly and the unique design completely removes any pressure from the ears/head.Sound is amazing looks cool on your head Cons: Does not say I love you back when I got to bed Apparently it is not legal to marry these headphones in the state of Arizona.Taking these headphones out for a romantic evening will get you laughed at.Does not make you run faster Could not be used as a weapon in the zombie apocalypse.5.0steelseries siberia v2 headset for league of legends heavens arcadeamazing headset!!!just got it and it works fantastic!gonna use it for skyping during league :D def recommend... ^_^3.0A Great Headset At A Great CostSteelseries makes many excellent products, this being one as well, but there is one key area this headset fails to deliver and unfortunately that is in quality of audio.If you're looking for the two in one combo (headphones and built-in microphone) then at this price range the Siberia V2 is highly recommended but if you can live with headphones and a clip-on mic the Audio Technica AD700 & Zalman Clip-On Mic is a vastly superior combination.Steelseries Sibera V2 Pros: Extremely comfortable.Very well built.High quality microphone.One of the most comfortable headsets that will fit any sized head.A very adequate cable length (minus the included extended cable.)An easy to reach and unobtrusive volume and microphone control device.Excellent for hip-hop and dubstep.Steelseries Sibera V2 Cons: Average quality highs.(Sound) Below average quality mids.(Sound) Above Average quality lows.(Sound) Poor soundstage.Not very good at all for gaming due to overall sound, particularly in FPS's.To put it simply the Siberia V2s just aren't very loud when it comes to anything other than bass.Bass drowns out vital in-game sounds, especially in first person shooters.Those explosions sound so cool!Too bad I couldn't hear the guy sneaking up behind me nor what direction he came from.Superior options at a cheaper price.Icemat Siberia Headset (clip-on microphone included).Steelseries bought Icemat, their current headset design is based off Icemat.$30 on EBay.JVC HARX700 headphones (no mic) $40 on Amazon.Zalman Clip-On Mic $7.90 (free shipping) Amazon seller.Steelseries Siberia Headset (V1, identical to Icemat Headset with clip-on microphone but it has the Steelseries box and logo on the headband) $70 on Amazon.The best option.Audio Technica AD700.In terms of design, comfortable level, soundstage, highs, mids, lows, and usefulness in games the AD700s are unbeatable at this price range.They fluctuate between $89-$98 on Amazon and the Zalman Clip-On Mic is $7.90 flat.If you have a small head the rubber band mod will set you right and after 100 hours of burn-in, which is when you'll get 100% of the audio quality for these headphones you'll never want another pair.4.0Great headset for the budget mindedThe steel series Siberia v2 headset packs a lot of quality for the money.I picked this headset up on Cyber Monday for $50, along with an Astro Pro Mix amp.My review of this headset will contain both the use of the astro mix amp, and without.So I want to keep this more focused on gaming, since this is a gaming headset.I can't tell you how angry it makes me reading reviews on gaming headsets where the reviewer is just talking about how great or terrible it sounds listening to classical music, when all you want to know is how well it performs while gaming!I will include a bit about music, but I won't wax on about it.So I've previously owned Turtle Beach x1, TB x3 (wireless), and Tritton AX pro headsets.I can say with great confidence these blow all of them combined out of the water!I also have experience using the Astro A40, and Sennheiser PC360s (Currently called the G4ME One) both with Astro Mix amp.Far and away the Mix amp with PC 360 is the best setup I've ever experienced (For gaming).------------------------------- Siberia V2 without mix amp tested on PC with AC Unity, Battlefield 4, and Left for Dead 2: *Good sound stage for positional Audio.Caught a few people sneaking up on me, but got caught a lot when a lot of sound was happening.Could not tell whether enemies were up high or low, but could hear them walking all around me.*Kind of quite compared to what I am use to, but still loud enough to make gaming enjoyable.*The Lows are very dominant, but not overwhelming.They Handle the blends of highs mids and lows all happening at the same time, without the sounds all bleeding together, or cutting out like some headsets (Astro A40).*Microphone works well, and friends noted that I sounded allot clearer and louder than before (which sometimes isn't always good) *Very Comfortable once broken in.Can wear them for hours and hours.I was worried about the ear pad material making my head sweat, but it doesn't.Before they were broken in, they clamped to my head and pressed together a bit too hard, but not much of an issue now that they are broken in.------------------------------ Siberia V2 With Astro Mix amp tested with Battlefield 4 on Xbox 360, and PC with AC Unity, Battlefield 4, and Left for Dead 2: *Great sound Stage for positional Audio.Noticeably better than without the mix amp (I run with the clean EQ).With some Juice, these things BANG!I could hear people or zombies sneaking up on me allot easier with other sounds banging in the headset.In battlefield, I could hear people running all around, And had an easier time telling where enemies were.Still had the problem of not being able to tell if they were high or low.* The lows were still more dominant, but the mids and highs sounded much better!No bleeding or smearing tones at all.Everything was very well defined, but the bass being more dominant, sucks sometimes for FPS gaming.Was awesome for Assassins Creed Unity.Makes it way more cinematic, and thus more enjoyable.*Microphone, of course, no difference.------------------------------ So the Headset by itself is good, but pump a bit more juice to it, and add Headset virtual surround, and they come to life!This is the least expensive headset I've ever purchased, but the best sounding.Forget Triton, forget Turtle beach.Comparing to the other High end sets in the Astro A40s, and the Sennheiser PC360s, I would say this is an incredible bang for your buck headset, but not the go to for a highest quality audio setup.Compared to the Astro A40s: *They sound way better overall.Better sound stage, better defined tones, however... With the Mix amp, The A40s barely edges out the Siberia V2 for positional queues, which I believe is the biggest factor for FPS games.The A40 however does have issues with allot of sounds happening simultaneously and the Highs are very dominant.So if there is an explosion, footsteps your tracking, gunfire and friends talking, it all sort of blurs together and sounds god awful.The Siberia V2 handles everything very well, and keeping everything better defined.Dollar for Dollar between the two, plain and simple.. Siberia V2 all the way.Compared to the PC 360s: Without the mix amp, I definitely prefer the Siberia V2.With the mix amp, however....The PC 360 wins by a large margin.The only thing the PC360 doesn't do as well is bass.But for gaming audio, too much bass can make you audibly blind for seconds at a time, and that's just when someone will sneak up and take you out.The PC360 with mix amp is hands down the best audio system I've ever experienced in gaming.Handles all sounds perfectly defined, and you can hear if something or someone is dropping in on you, or something from any direction, as well as how far away that sound is.It's absolutely amazing!Sorry for rambling there, I'm just a big fan of that configuration.But you're talking a $330 ($200 for the headset $130 for the Amp) config vs $180.Sound Stage: 7/10 Overall sound: 8/10 Comfort: 7/10 Finally, the music review section.Audiophiles who review gaming headsets against listening to music will love this detailed review: It sounds good..... (lol) Hip-Hop and Dub step are the standout genres, especially with an amp.Hope this helps someone out, who was in my position of wanting to find a quality headset for gaming audio, across multiple platforms, but didn't want to break the bank.If you have any questions or would like further information, write me a comment and I'll get back to you.5.0Five Starsperfect basketball, just what my son wanted.5.0Five Starsnice product, fast shipment2.0Leaks fasterI have to say this pump barely works.I did read the reviews, and when I saw people saying it leaking, I didn't expect it to be this bad.Maybe I got the super leaking one, but it's definitely unacceptable.I used it only once, and when I tried to put air into the ball, it leaked faster than inflating.So I ended up with a more loose ball and more tired than playing a game!In one word, I hate it... even with this price2.0Just barely functionalThis pump is just *barely* effective at inflating my basketball.When you put the needle in the ball, air starts leaking from the top of the pump immediately.I have to pump as fast as I can to outpace the constant leak.The pump is cheap, and it's technically working, but it sucks.Buy something else.4.0Great for the Price!This pump works well, does its job but overall it looks a bit cheap in construction and it has a tendency to leak air on the back so you have to pull the ball quickly or risk deflating it, but for six bucks is a bargain4.0Gets the job done just fineWow, there are a lot of reviewers unhappy with how this pump leaks air/deflates the ball/feels cheap, etc.I guess I must have gotten lucky with the quality of my pump because I have been using this product regularly for several months with none of those problems.One of the great things about this pump is you can put it back into the plastic case it came in (snaps shut) before throwing it into your gym bag.I suspect that if I didn't use the case the pump would have experienced significantly more wear and tear and may be more leaky.Not sure, but for a $5 pump that gets used and abused, can you really expect it NOT to leak?Overall a good product for the price and just the ticket for inflation needs before hitting the hardwood.I will continue to give Spalding my business for basketballs and related accessories.2.0Poor design - use carefullyLike most inexpensive plastic pumps, this pump has a bit of a leakage, which is not a big deal but unlike some other models, this pump does not have a soft tube connecting the pump and the needle - the needle is inserted directly into the pump.My first time using it, I had to press the pump into the ball to minimize the air leakage, and with one careless slip I broke the needle and left it inside the ball, and the ball now bounces with an extra jingle and is pretty much unplayable.Careful: this pump is not fool proof!5.0Works great for meI got this today to use with my new soccer ball, It came packaged in a protective manner on time and included the needle in the handle.It took maybe 7 pumps and my soccer ball was ready to go.The handle is plastic and the body is aluminum.Works perfectly for what I need so if your needs are similar I recommend.4.0Small but does the JobThis is a good little pump that I use to inflate all my grandsons play ball.It is just the right size for me to keep in the house.It is very good for blowing up balloons too.5.0EfficientEasy to store and does it's job; there is even a place to put the pin so that the small thing doesn't go missing.3.0Good pump but careful you dont lose the needle cap.Great pump but I lost the little valve at the top that holds the needle in 20 minutes after receiving.Wish it were tethered to the handle.Ah well, needles are cheap.5.0Works but not much better for big thingsI had a 3ft beach ball I needed to fill and this worked fine but it still took a long time to fill the beach ball.5.0Good movie packI am not a football fan, but these are some great movies.Not a huge fan of Wildcats, but the other three are really great movies.We are Marshall is an exceptionally wonderful movie.5.0Great ValueMy husband really wanted The Replacements so in searching for it I found this set of 4 films.It was great to get 4 wonderful football movies for the price of one and he loved the gift.5.0Incredible deal on two great movies: Replacements and We are Marshall!Incredible deal on two great movies: Replacements and We are Marshall!Replacements is a classic fun movie with great actors having a blast at their craft.Brooke Langton is a sweet&sexy great-bodied perfect sweetheart female lead(priorities first).Pace of directing and Musical score is purrfect and sensuous...yes, both football and women can both be sensuous.Hackman is his usual iconic, alpha-male, authority-figure, award-winning actor self.I love Keanu Reeves as both a person and actor and his role suits him perfectly.And you sincerely care about each and every character actor in this film with the director, Howard Deutch, excelling at developing them all with signature cameo segments.Jon Favreau is a fine actor and a cuddly crazy teddy bear.Rhys Ifans of "Notting Hill' fame is side splittingly awesome and perfectly cast as the Welsh kicker/Gambler Deadbeat.Overall a 5 star experience.We are Marshall is a difficult story to tell and it balances tragedy with triumph very well and rates a 5 star rating as well.The other two films range from obnoxious excrement(Wildcats) to dark, overblown Stonish disgracefully, poorly conceived and directed(Any Given Sunday).I'm tempted to shred both discs as "Crimes Against Humanity."5.0Great pack for sport moviesVery entertaining grouping.Must have for completion of your sports movie collection.Replacements never gets old!Great cast of characters.5.0nice economic packagei really like these movies and enjoy being able to watch them when I want to.It is also very convenient to have all four in one package.5.0Should be the standard ball that comes with the SKLZ hoop.So much nicer.We own a SKLZ over the door hoop that came with a small hard rubber ball, which is nice, but wow that thing really slams into walls.Our kids usually use a softer blowup ball for the SKLZ hoop.The SKLZ mini swish foam ball is perfect for this set and really needs to be the standard ball that comes with the hoop.It's much more squishy, softer on walls, bounces like heck, the perfect size for little hands, and is lighter.So glad we got this!!!UPDATE: Husband notes this ball is too slick for a basketball.Thought I'd add that.Even though it doesn't bother me, he was annoyed by the texture whereas the included basketball feels more like a real basketball.5.0Awesome!Love this little ball.Great bounce!Awesome!Love this little ball.A foam ball is a foam ball, right?Well, what makes this little foam different from all the others my little boy has had over the years, is that this one has a great BOUNCE to it.If your kid likes to bounce a ball in the house, and the sound drives you nuts, this SKLZ Pro Mini Swish Foam Ball will be a lifesaver.Other than having a great bounce, it's a typical soft (quiet) foam ball.Well worth the price.5.0Best indoor basketball ever!Such a high quality product.This ball is very durable and well-made.It bounces well compared to other foam balls I've used in the past.It has has enough weight for accurate shooting, even from long distance, and its size is not too small.This ball is perfect for indoor use because it creates little noise and is safe to use around fragile items.I much prefer this ball to the standard ball that comes with the SKLZ Pro Mini Hoop because it is quieter and less destructive.Product arrived on the date specified and was packaged neat and securely.I very much recommend this ball for use with the SKLZ Pro Mini Hoop or any other indoor basketball hoop!5.0Kids have lots of fun with thisThis is lots of fun and it is *the* only way I would use the SKLZ mini hoop indoors.It is well made, it retains its shape and it works well with the hoop.This being made of foam, you are giving up some bounce, but I believe that to be for the better of all the objects which can easily break inside....5.0A Terrific Little BallThis Saturday was sweltering hot and the resident six-year-old and I decided to spend an at home day.And a surprisingly long amount of time was spent with this little ball!This a durable and surprisingly high quality little ball and it's good for some hard play.We did hallway soccer, bedroom kickball, and even a little patio basketball when it finally cooled down.The ball hit feet, tables, walls, and an occasional head (mine) and still looks as good as new.And it's got a great bounce to it!If you have little ones, please note that the ball is very firm.If it hits you in the face (been there!)it will sting, so play gently with a little one.But older kids will love the durability of this one.It can definitely handle a little rough housing.My daughter and I are pleased with this one!5.0Don't waste your time with anything else.These are PERFECT...I buy one a year because we actively use and beat the heck out of ours and always end up needing a new one, not due to lack of quality, but to the extreme amount of use it gets both in our household and even on active tackle football teams that my oldest son plays QB on... once you go up to the real leather official NFL ball, there is no going back... nothing beats it.You can sense the quality in the feel and see the quality in the flight of the ball compared to others.One year I bought one of these and a high quality composite, thinking we would use the composite during bad weather to save the official one... yeah, that never happened, the official one is so much better eventually you just say... the heck with it... and use it even during the bad weather (hence why eventually you want a brand new one again)!5.0Only the best will do for this couch potatoThe real deal here folks- I got this football because when I'm watching football on TV I have to also be holding a football for some reason.This ball also excels when I toss it up in the air on the couch to myself, hit the wall with it- knocking down the picture frames, bounce it into my wife's drink- knocking it over and scaring the cats.It's also awesome at lurking in the dark for me to trip over in the middle of the night.I ask a lot of my football, and as such I demand an official NFL Game Football.4.0The Real DealThis review is coming from a person who has own composite footballs all their life.When the ball first arrived I though I got some cheap knock off.The ball was pale, dull, colors were all uneven, and slick.I though to myself I should have gotten another composite footballs because a leather football looks like crap.I then followed the care instructions on the box.To revitalize tacky grip: -Using a brush & moderate pressure, brush the ball completely -Using a damp towel, quickly rub the ball completely.Do not saturate the ball with water.-While the ball is still damp, brush it again to bring tack back the surface of the leather It is amazing what this did to the ball.I performed these procedures twice and all I can say is WOW!!!It totally transformed the ball completely.The ball is now a reddish brown color.The ball has a nice shine to it.The colors are now all even is very tacky.Just to note, when you wipe the ball down with a damp towel red dye will come off the ball.I used a paper towel knowing this would happen.I am very happy that I purchased this ball.Will never get a composite again.4.0Know what you're buyingThis is the official football used by the NFL and you'll be paying for it.If you want an affordable, durable, all-weather football, there are great balls by Spaulding, Nike, even Wilson, in the $20-$40 range.Now that doesn't mean the Wilson F1100 official football is a rip-off, just realize what you're buying.It's a great ball, with a great feel, that is pretty durable.If you've played basketball with a leather ball, you'll recognize that a leather ball is not as sticky as the high tact, composite-leather balls we're mostly used to playing with.That's not to say it's slippery as a wet fish either, but the slight difference in material is worth noting.A football that costs upwards of $70 is mostly for the fact that you're getting the official ball used by the NFL.If you want the authentic football that you see your favorite players using, then this is the football for you.If you're looking for a good ol' fashioned ball that you won't mind getting scuffed and dirty (as all footballs get, this one included) then there are lots of much cheaper footballs out there that perform just as effectively.5.0Great...Just understand a few thingsI have bought 2 of these, about a year apart.They are leather and although I've never actually played NFL football, they do appear to be the exact game balls used in NFL games.One should realize, however, that when you receive the ball you purchase, it will not be broken in and game ready.In other words, Tom Brady would not want to use it during an AFC Championship against the Colts.Balls actually used for play are well broken in, shiny, tacky to the touch with great grip, and often much darker than the brand new ball you buy.Your new ball will be light in color, slippery, and covered with a red dye that will bleed if the ball gets wet.A little light wipe down with a wet cloth and maybe even some saddle soap will help remove the dye.Once your ball is dry, I suggest regulary rubbing it with a shoe polish brush (or Wilson's proprietary brush if you believe them) to bring it to a shine and give it that tacky feel like the pros expect.My 1 year old ball is much darker than my new ball and I believe it may simply be darkening with time, as I have followed the same break-in procedures for both.See pictures below.The first picture is before and after of the SAME BALL, broken-in (top) and untouched (bottom).The second picture is my 1 year old ball (left) next to my new, untouched ball (right).And the brush pictured is what you can use to dry rub the ball to bring its tacky feel back.Ultimately, the ball is the real deal, and that alone makes it awesome, but it also feels and plays like a great ball as long as you realize how to make it so.1.0Do not buy from THIS vendor!(Brybelly Holdings)Christmas Eve and I have NO NEEDLE for this #%@ Air Pump.The description clearly states needle is included, but it WAS NOT.So now my 9 year child gets to play hoops with a COMPLETELY FLAT BALL!!!Horrible quality assurance with this vendor!STAY AWAY from Brybelly Holdings Inc.2.0NEEDLE MISSING!I got everything as expected EXCEPT the NEEDLE ....so how are you supposed to inflate a ball without one of the most important parts...the NEEDLE!...now i'm stuck with a basketball hoop and 2 balls, useless pump because there was no NEEDLE in the package...thank you!...3.0DecentCrown Sporting Goods Mini Basketball with Needle and Inflation Pump, 5-Inch...pretty decent, kids had fun with it, playing around with the ball.5.0Great for Little handsMy grandson is 4 and absolutely loved this basket ball.Its works great for little hands.He thought I had it made just for him!5.0So happy I got it for himGot this for my 2 year old son who is obsessed with baby size basketballs.He loves it!!!So happy I got it for him.2.0Beware Amazon Maybe Selling Inferior Products Passing Them Off As The Real DealI bought a new Spalding NBA Official Game Basketball 1 1/2 months ago or I would have shipped it back the ball has never been outdoors and only used indoors on a wooden floor at my college or shot at my YMCA both have great floors.I believe the ball was defective as it looks a year old or older.I don't know where I can get this made right.I thought about calling Spalding but since I bought it on Amazon for $139 I don't think I'd have any recourse.We have to use this ball to get ready for NBA combines and you have to have a ball to practice with you'll be using in the NBA to get the feel of it because there is a big difference and can't wait the weeks it would take to send it back wait on them another few weeks for them to decide what they want to do.I called Spalding to get 1 before ordering on Amazon but I had to buy 4 @ $160 a piece.I'm sending a 2 pics you tell me if I'm wrong to criticize this ball.I received this ball on June 27th 2015 from Amazon today is August 12 2015.As I took pics of it when I received it on June 27th and was so excited to have it and today August 12th someone tell I'm just being hyper critical!5.0Hands down the best ball I have ever played withRequires breaking-in.Hands down the best ball I have ever played with.Really need to be experienced with playing different basketballs to appreciate this ball.I was looking for a good indoor basketball, but I never like the bounce of Wilson evolution or Wilson Solution balls--there is a delayed bounce to it.Spalding also don't make the old tf-1000 as the new ones are a little heavier, and get heavier with more play.If you are looking for a competitive indoor basketball, I recommend getting this ball--has true bounce and weight to it.5.0Best money spent on AmazonAfter receiving this ball, I wasn't too disappointed with no @NBA, Just having silvers signature cool enough.The ball does get scraped up easily and found that it is worse right out of the box, so might need to be extra careful until it is a couple weeks old.The bounce is terrific and sound going through the net gets me hard.Everyone has there own way of breaking the ball in, and I would say not to use any conditioner as it makes it too greasy.However, some cleaner could be ok after some court time if she's dirty.I'm confident this ball will get much better as it becomes softer over time.I wish a few more people had a leather ball because now the even the evolution feels way too spongy and gets real wet.You won't be disappointed in getting this ball if you have the patience and care necessary to own it.5.0Great Product, Genuine and Authentic!Must treat yourself to one of these!(as of 8/14/2015)Just gonna cut to the chase with this review, if you want to see the longer version scroll down...This ball is authentic, nice grip, great feel to the ball, bounces perfect and amazon shipped inflated in the original Spalding packaging.I got the newest version of the ball where there's the @NBA to the left of the logo.Would recommend anyone who loves the game of basketball to give this one a shot at least once in your balling career!Longer Version: A little side-note first, I'm a long time Amazon customer since 2005 but this would be my first review ever because how happy I am with the product!)Okay, Here goes!This is by far the best basketball that I've ever purchased...I've been playing basketball for 13 year...during that period of time, I've owned more than 10 basketball just to name a few Spalding's TF-1000, neve-flat, zi/o, infusion...Molten's GM7 and a couple of Wilsons...This ball has the nicest grip to it straight-out-of-the-box....not to mention all the reviews on how it gets even better after 3~6 month of proper break-in.It is a little unfair to put the real deal against the ones that I've listed above, but if you are just like me, a person who never ever even have the thought of dropping $100+ on a basketball crossed your mind, do yourself a favor and pick this thing up.I bought it because of the love I have for basketball and I believe that everyone who love basketball as much as I do should at least spoil themselves a little bit for once and pick up this genuine leather basketball.There's a reason why these are the official game ball of the NBA, lets show some respect to the creator of this awesome product and to the game itself.*You know you have done something right when you crack a huge smile on your face the second you place your hand on one of these!3.0Good ball but leather is not what I expectedGood ball but leather is not what I expected.The gym I go to got Wilson basketballs that leather is shinier and with better grip and feel better in the hand.Overall OK But Not For That price2.0Breaks within a few usesI bought these needles to pump up a Basketball and was very disapointed.The needles both broke the third time I used them.They are junk.5.0Works greatYou know what you're getting with these inflating needles.Just make sure you have the type pump which allows you to screw the inflating needle onto the end, and you're good to go (are there any pumps which don't work like this?).Works just as you'd expect it.5.0the needle will go in very smooth & come out like a charmI have a little trick that will save ball needles from breaking off.I have coached sports for many years & always have used this little technique.If you dip the needle about halfway or 3/4 through any jar of vaseline or some other type of inexpensive lub, the needle will go in very smooth & come out like a charm.After doing that, I have never had any more problems with any needles, even the cheap ones.I hope that helps people that have problems with breaking needles.Have a great day.5.0Excellent Inflating NeedlesI bought these needles just to fill in my order to get Free shipping.However, they turned out to be the best needles I have ever had.They manufactured with smooth air outlet holes and smaller diameter than other needles.4.0Be careful, this is fragile.This item is fragile, so be careful, do not break it when you inflate, otherwise troubles come.3.0Good not great.I most like the feel of the grip of the ball.I can palm it, which is saying something.Plus it is holding up after two street ball sessions.My biggest problem with it is the channels.They transition from the orange panel to the channel so abruptly that it almost makes a corner.So when the ball is sliding against your hand you feel that ridge and it is almost like it is scrapping your skin.I dislike the channels enough to not recommend this ball.5.0One of the best outdoor bballsThe Wilson NCAA Replica 29.5" on Amazon for $25 is the best deal going in my opinion.The covers have a great feel and are less slick than most.The downside is that these covers tend to wear out sooner than the "less grippy" covers of other manufacturers.5.0feels and acts just like a basketball shouldI had to buy this after my 110 lb.pit/mastiff destroyed my neighbors basketball.This was the same make and model as my neighbor's ball, except without the teeth marks or hole.It's round, has lines and pebbling and looks, feels and acts just like a basketball should.Not exactly sure what else to write.5.0Best ballLove it.This is my third one.Always the ball of choice come game time.I use it outside mainly now which is a shame but it is holding up well.Be careful cause they seem to grow legs and walk off at the end of the day.2.0too wide of channelsthe channels on this are way too big..they kind of dug into my fingers as i played outside...if i could have, i would have returned it.(how to return a used bball?)the NBA//Zio is a better option in my humble opinion if the channels were more narrow, the ball would be sweet.5.0My son liked using my daughters TF-150 for his practice's which started ...I intially bought our first ball (T-150) for my daughter who plays in several basketball leagues.My son liked using my daughters TF-150 for his practice's which started them to fight over it so I purchase not only one more but two more, a second ball as a back up.Trust me if you have kids you know what I mean and yes all three balls get's used.The grip of the basketball is really great, it holds up well on outdoor courts and my children are able to excell with their ball handling skills.One draw back that it does loose a little air from time to time but nothing a quick few air pumps can take care of and the ball is right back functioning perfect.My kids play a lot of basketball and we have tried many diffrent brands and this one seems to stand up to their use and function.4.0#BOSSBASKETBALLThis ball has the best grip But the linings in the ball fade quickly but the ball is still #BOSS3.0good for seven year oldperfect for playgrond and learning skills for a young player.....he is learn how to shoot, drilble and i am very5.0Official NBA Ball Vs. TF1000, NBA composite, Wilson Solution/EvolutionAs an owner of many basketballs and always interested to add basketballs to my shooting rack, I finally dedicated some time and money to get the official NBA leather game ball and took time to break it in before properly reviewing it.I must note that all the basketballs are at 8psi (which is the median of the nba psi standards of 7.5-8.5psi).The official NBA Ball comes out of the box really slick.It feels cheap but not like a $10 rubber ball that you'd find at a toy store or the promotional balls you'd get from Pizza Hut years ago.A leather ball feels completely different from any ball a non-competitive player has played with.Most of us that play basketball for fun usually just played with any ball.Over time, recreational players get used to the feel these balls have and that's why they are quick to shoot down the NBA ball.When I brought both NBA ball types to games (leather and composite), most players thought that the leather NBA ball was the ball that was rejected by the NBA players.They were so sure of it.On the flip side, they thought that the NBA composite ball was the current basketball used.Obviously they never played with anything of this grade and didn't know what a leather ball felt like.Initially, the leather ball feels heavier as a reviewer said and takes a long time to break in.The best method of breaking it in for me was a two part process.1.I got some leather conditioner, rubbed it with a rag and let it dry.2.The next day I would go and shoot around with it for a few hours.Dribbling breaks it in and with this conditioner, it broke it at a faster rate.Now that it's broken in, it's an absolutely fantastic ball.Nothing comes close to it.The more you play with it, the better it feels.It holds air really well and doesn't leave scuff marks on your hands.However, it is a real sensitive ball and has a couple noticeable scuff marks.About a half inch each.Doesn't affect the ball outside of ruining the perfect image you see in the product description.I must note that all the balls used have the same PSI (about 7.5, which is the median based on NBA rules).I am a short player and have small hands.I don't have any problems with this ball.I have to disagree with another reviewer about having to be a "man-child" or needing to be strong to use this ball.It's still a ball!It feels lighter as you break it in but that may also be due to getting used to playing with it.I did notice that it is more forgiving on the rim as a shooter and as many people have said, "it feels right".What does this mean?You would have to shoot around with it when it is broken in to feel the same way.When it is not broken in, it may feel too slick, slippery and may be frustrating to use.Don't lose your patience or give it a bad review until you break it in.I also think it has a distinct sound when you get nothing-but-net.It's a better sound and makes you want to continue to make swishes.I use this ball in a league I play in as well as the other balls mentioned in this review and for our team at least, our shooting percentage is higher with the leather NBA ball.There are a lot of variables of game shooting but just wanted to make a note of that.The NBA composite ball feels great when you start playing with it.Everyone on my rec.team preferred it initially because it has a soft and nice grip.After it got broken in a bit, it began to leave little burns on the tips of my fingers and on the inside of my palms.Since I've broken it in even more, it lost the great grip but it's still pretty solid.I don't think it's incredibly slippery when wet but it's not like the leather ball.When the leather ball is wet, it actually feels better.That's probably why you see Steve Nash lick his fingers as he dribbles up court.You don't need the leather ball to be wet to feel nice but it does feel nice wet when other composite balls feel slightly slippery.In the end, some people don't give the composite ball a chance because it was rejected by the NBA players.They automatically say it's trash without playing with it.I think it's the best composite basketball out there.It would be my number 2 basketball from the basketballs listed here.Since it's hard to find the defunct NBA composite basketball, I doubt most people will have the option to test it for themselves.(update: When I first wrote this, I did believe it was the best composite out there but I feel that it has declined to the point where I cannot stand by that comment.It IS the best composite ball until you reach a certain point and then it declines.I haven't played with it as much of late due to the recent declines.I have played with other composite balls nearly as much and they did not decline as fast as the NBA composite).The Wilson Solution (official college ball) is a great ball as well but also of the composite variety.It's nice overall but for the price, I'd rather have the official nba ball or the TF 1000.This is the same for the Wilson Evolution.Both Wilson balls are good but they are too spongy for my taste.I have a Solution and a couple of my teammates have Evolutions.I like the Solution better.The TF 1000 (official high school ball) is also a nice ball and has great grip and feel.The reason why it's so popular is that the grip is nearly as good as the NBA comp.ball but without the bad press.The newer ZK Pro feels very similar to the Wilson Solution yet it's cheaper in price.Better yet, The TF-1000 composite, the cheaper model to the ZK Pro feels better than the more expensive ZK Pro out of the box.The catch is after you play with both of them for awhile, the TF-1000 composite fades in quality while the ZK-Pro holds up better.I guess the durability is what makes the ZK Pro worth 20 dollars more.-- The cheaper 'microfiber composite' TF-1000 ball actually feels better than the ZK Pro.Initially the price difference was 20 dollars but now you can find the difference to be $5-$10.I think they are close in quality but the ZK-Pro seems a bit bouncier and provides longer rebounds, which I find to be a sign of the ball being too spongy.I find this to be true with the Wilson basketballs.I do not find this to be much of a problem with the 'microfiber' or the nba composite basketball.For those on the fence, the ZK pro or the TF-1000 composite ball may be your best bet.If you're used to playing with a rubber, composite ball, you will probably be the most satisfied with the TF balls.For quality and durability, I would suggest spending a little extra on the NBA ball.I've had all of these basketballs for a year or more and while the TF's, Wilsons and the NBA composite are nice, the quality seems to fade over time while the leather NBA ball just seems to keep getting better with each indoor run.Finally, there are many good basketballs out there.I have played and liked the Molten GL7, The Baden Lexum Elite and the Nike 4005 balls.You won't go wrong with any of these basketballs--- But if 'on a desert island', I would go with the NBA leather basketball over any ball out there.If I couldn't afford the NBA leather basketball, I would go with the TF-1000 microfiber composite although you are aware that the TF-1000s do have a relatively short shelf life compared to their leather counterparts.4.0GREAT BALL, however; for hoop zealots onlyThere's nothing greater than: " OK, that's 10, let's run".After wearing out two Spalding TF1000's (both were lost, or stolen...I can't remember) I was checking out the NBA ball.I knew about the slick feel, that it requires a lot of breaking in, that no one would want to play with it in the games.I even called Spalding and they told me that the NBA balls are pre-broken in for the pros.I figured "Hey, where I play there are always 2 or 3 fairly new TF 1000's around to use for "game" balls anyway".So....I got my NBA leather ball, and yes no one wants to use it as "game" ball; however I do notice that between games when we are shooting around, that the "slickness" doesn't seem to effect anybody's shot.I just love shooting with it.I have noticed that in the summer I can palm it.Maybe it's just the humidity, in general, or the porosity of the leather absorbing humidity.Even in the winter if I've been playing and have worked up a good sweat, I find that I can palm it.So there may be something to the leather absorbing moisture thing.I've had mine almost a year, and to me it feels better and better all the time, yet still has never seen game action.I'll admit, it just does not have the tacky and soft feel of a new or not worn out TF1000.Bottom line is: never use it outdoors, which is also true for the TF1000; don't expect anyone to want to use it for the "game" ball.Just get it if you love basketball, and appreciate the feel of it and how sounds as it drains in, or how it bounces off the rim.You won't wear it out.And I hope mine eventually breaks in to the point it will be used as "game" ball and if that happens I'll submit another review.Meanwhile.I'm glad I got my NBA leather ball.But I'm admitting that I am truly a basketball nut, so you gotta just decide for yourself if getting this ball is for you.I hope you found this helpful.5.0it is right for you?I don't know...but I love it.I first had the Official NBA ball back when I was 14 yrs old (30 now) and my family belonged to the YMCA and it lasted me about 6 years before it got a little warped when I had it in storage for 1 year.It should last a long time as long as you take care of it-- so no kicking the ball or leaving it sitting in your car exposed to the sun.As a teenager I didn't really think about the differences-- since then, Wilson, Spalding and Baden all have similar "technologies" to increase the feel of the ball.I would venture that 99% of those reading reviews have never practiced with the NBA ball before (and if they have it might have been with a ball already broken in).Most will be disappointed with this ball out of the box because they are used to composite balls.The 3 major manufacturers are all battling for market share-- their goal is to get you to buy and keep buying their product.They do this 2 ways: #1: the feel of the ball out of the box.Most need instant gratification and most don't play 5 times a week and don't want to wait 5 months to break-in a ball.Composites "feel" good right out of the box-- they feel even better after 3 months of usage.#2: overall tackiness/sticky/soft technology.The stickier and the softer the ball the better a person can "handle" the ball which translates to better player performance.(a normal basketball shouldn't have "cushion" technology) Composite balls have identical weight and size to the NBA ball-- but the stickiness of the ball gives the user an "illusion" of being smaller since better grip makes you think the ball is smaller and lighter in your hand.As other reviewers have noted this NBA ball will not make you or your shot better just because it's a $80-100 ball.You're paying for the genuine leather and "NBA" brand name.But I will say this-- if you play and practice with the NBA ball-- going back and playing a game with a composite ball will actually feel good since the composite ball's technologies heighten your handling abilities-- the composite ball will feel smaller and easier to hold and shoot (think of baseball hitters using a weighted donut/bat before coming to hit).But practicing with a composite ball then trying to play with NBA ball will not feel good.I don't mind the feel of composite balls--for the past 3 years the gym I belong to has used Wilson Evolution, Solution, Spalding and Baden Elite indoor balls.They're all good balls.The main problem with composites is developing tiny cuts on the tips of my index and middle fingers.I normally play/practice 3-5 times a week and shoot close to 250-300 times during each session and new composite balls make it so I cannot actually play 2 days in a row without developing cuts, so about 3 months ago I bought the NBA ball and wish I had done it sooner as I stopped getting the cuts-- I actually don't mind the feel out of the box but it still needs several more months to soften up.My suggestion to most is to get a composite ball if you are not serious about the game or just like playing 3-on-3 games 3 times a week.The NBA ball really is for people who have had the ball before and love the feel of a leather ball or those who take a high number of shots when practicing and don't want cuts on their fingers.If you are thinking of this for your young teenager, I would actually recommend it-- playing and developing good handling/shooting skills with this NBA ball will only help their game.5.0The standardFirst off, this is not the tackiest, softest basketball out there.It is a real basketball.It feels larger, harder, and heavier than most other basketballs that are popular now for indoor play.All the microfiber basketballs that have come out that allow everybody to palm the ball like MJ are like toys compared to this.Consequently, many people who are used to the microfiber basketballs hate these.But, to me at least, these are what basketballs are supposed to be.They feel right, bounce right, and rebound like a basketball should.Highly recommended.5.0The best indoor ball you can buyAs an avid basketball collector, I have played with and own almost every quality basketball on the market.As a kid growing up throughout the 90's, my schools often consisted of the ORIGINAL and amazing Spalding TF-1000 (often had narrow channels as well).Playing at my local leisure center, I've also often encountered the Wilson Evolution (which is another amazing ball).Having the belief that the pros played with the best feeling ball, I begged my parents to buy me the NBA game ball (I must have been about 10 at the time).It was expensive, and feeling it for the first time I was a little bit disappointed.When I first felt the ball, it felt very hard and slippery.Growing up around composite leather balls, I had no idea what a real leather ball was supposed to feel like.However, I still had a love for it because it held sentimental value.Playing with the ball almost every weekend (indoors of course), I noticed that it started to feel better and better.Once the ball was fully broken in, it easily became the best ball I have ever played with.Now onto the ball itself, like I said earlier it starts out hard and slippery with barely any tackiness.Once the ball is broken in though, the color darkens, it has better grip when your hands get sweaty, and of course gets softer.However, it is not a "cushioned" type of soft that is associated with Wilson or Baden basketballs, but rather the material itself starts to loosen up.It is not the softest or grippiest ball out there, but the control you get with this ball is amazing.It feels consistently round (making it easier to shoot), and has that perfect amount of slide which is needed for a good release on the ball.It is basically the perfect balance of everything.It has the best indoor durability I have seen, and it is not too grippy or too soft.Now the most important thing when considering buying an NBA game ball, is that you need to realize there are different types of them (and I am not talking about the old rejected composite ball).I have noticed there are two styles (I happen to own both).My first ball had a very glossy and shiny orange finish on it, and had very shallow logos that easily faded when played with (the logos almost looked like they were painted).As this ball started to break in, it got even shinier and felt very smooth to the touch.This ball also rarely absorbed any moisture, but still had decent grip when my hands were sweaty.My second ball had basically no finish on it, and had a very "dry" and mustard color to it.The logos on this ball were much deeper, and barely faded as it was played with.Once it started to break in, the color darkened, the ball got much shinier, and the material softened significantly.It easily absorbed moisture, and the grip is amazing with sweaty palms.Now you can't go wrong with either style, but my preference is the second style I mentioned.People claim that Spalding doesn't sell the "real" NBA game ball to the public, but they actually do.I have seen both styles played with in the NBA (although the second style with the deep writing is more common).Another thing, is that don't expect people to choose your ball for a pick up game.Everyone is too used to the excessively soft composite balls on the market nowadays.However, I have never encountered a composite ball with as much control and as much character as the NBA game ball.Pros: Best indoor durability; feels amazing to shoot and dribble; unmatched control; grip increases when hands are sweaty Cons: Worst outdoor durability; high price; LONGGGG break in period; different "styles" of the NBA game ball may discourage buyers I will be posting reviews of other basketballs when I have the chance.5.0fun productthis is a fun little ball for kids to score baskets at home.It mimics real basketball.Its very durable and easy to grip.My little one picked up Skilz hoop and this ball.they go very good together and offer hour of fun for kids and adults.I actually loved the set so much I ordered a basketball hoop for outdoors through Amazon.Amazon has the best price for it.I am a proud owner of 2 SKILZ hoops.One for outside and one for inside.It keeps the little ones busy and active.Great quality and durable.If you also experience problems with Skilz brand they have an extremely great customer service and offer to replace parts for free.Its a great quality company to buy from.5.0Great perfect size small ballI bought this 5-1/2" ball as a replacement to the 5" ball that came with my SKLZ Pro Mini Hoop basketball set.It worked great for this size hoop.Better constructed than the original ball which split after moderate use.Buy it, you'll like it!4.0First one was broken, but customer service was niceI bought this to replace the first ball that came with the SKLZ Pro Mini Hoop.This one is slightly larger than the first one, which developed a large bump which eventually caused the ball to pop.The first ball I was sent wouldn't hold pressure for more than a few hours.I emailed SKLZ about my issues, and they actually sent out two new balls, both of which seem to work fine.The overall quality of the balls may be hit or miss, but their customer service was very accommodating.5.0Great toy!This (along with the SKLZ Mini Pro Basketball XL Hoop) might be one of the best things I've purchased for my son.He plays for hours, both by himself and with his friends, when the weather is too yucky to go outside.Great addition to his play room!5.0One of the best gifts EVERAlong with the SKLZ Pro Mini Hoop, the balls and the hoop are an absolute staple in our household.All three boys (7, 4 and 2) play.Had to purchase an additional ball as the first two developed "dimples" and needed to be replaced.But for the amount they play with this toy, I'll gladly buy more balls as needed.5.0Best Basketball Training AidIf you could buy only one basketball training aid, this should be it.I've played ball for a long time, I'm 23 right now and I've only attended one basketball camp in my life.My basketball handles and court vision have always been just mediocre.Then I made an effort to improve these skills so I ordered these goggles and this is the single best training aid I've ever used.I was amazed at how sloppy my ball handling was after putting these on, I couldn't keep a consistent dribble without having the lower peripheral vision.These goggles force you to look down the court and your pg skills will greatly benefit.I'm in the process of doing intense dribbling drills with these goggles on to improve my ball handling, and I'm already starting to see noticable improvement.This is the hands down the best PG aid ever, and it would still be tremendously useful for any other player.5.0Good training gogglesThere are perfect for training youth ball-handling skills.My kids both use them on their own time and with their teams.Gets kids in the habit of looking down the court and not at the floor.You can adjust them to fit all sizes.5.0Not only for sports ;)I am the piano teacher and I use this product with my young students to prevent them from constantly looking at their hands as they play.These specs are fun and really help little ones to read the music.5.0Great tool!I purchased these for the high school team I coach.I had to replace the old ones I had.My team likes the way they fit.They are easy to get on and off.These are nicer and have a new updated look so the players dont feel so weird wearing them.Every team needs to use them for dribbling drills.They really help.5.0Simple and ComfortableI thought these would be hard plastic, but the glasses are flexible and comfortable to wear.This simple idea works perfectly.I can't see the ball when I dribble but I can do everything else just fine.4.0Good productRecently I had the chance to review a product from Crown Sporting Goods.Mini basketballs with a needle and inflation pump, and I must say they were a lot of fun.It's a set of 3 and are 5 inch.I inflated them easily and they worked fine.No leaks or holes, and inflated quickly.My dog had a blast playing with them too!5.0Great mini basketballs!We bought these for my son's birthday to go with a plastic basketball hoop we already have.They are exactly the same size as the ball it came with - only they feel just like a real rubber basketball rather than the plastic look alike that came with the hoop.They have a great bounce, and we love them!5.0good quality, cheap, free pump toogot this as a present, inflated all 3 with no issue.good quality material, i doubt they will pop (they haven't after heavy use in the last 3 weeks, eg.giant beer-pong).the prices seems good, especially considering the durability.the included pump was a slow at inflating the balls, but did the job first try (though i did use a different pump for the other balls, for speed).i saw a couple reviews where people had overinflated (damaged the balls), or couldn't use the provided pump 'didn't work'... but if you have a functioning brain (maybe some creativity too), the pump is NOT an issue!!;-)5.0good b-balls!They worked well with my bedroom door hoop, big enough to work with, but not too big for your hand.Nice bounce.Thanks!5.0Great quality item we use them with our indoor basket ...Great quality item we use them with our indoor basket ball hoop just the right size for the little kids5.0Nice little Pump and Pressure GaugeNice size for my gym bag and no more guessing at the correct pressure.The pressure gage is easy to read and it comes with an extra needle.You really can't beet the price I've seen just the pump going for way more then this.2.0Not too sturdyThis package does well on the accessories, although I have never broken the needle so I don't know why I need 3 of them.The biggest complaint I have is with the primary unit itself...It is extremely flimsy and made of cheap plastic.Every pump I feel like I am going to snap the handle.I've only ever owned one ball pump before this one and it was so much more rigid.I'd still be using that one today if I didn't lose it.4.0FranklinShe has been on a traveling team for six years and varsity on her high school team for four years.She really recommends this as a necessity for every player.GREAT PRODUCT!!5.0PerfectI bought this item being skeptical at first about the handle and needle quality but all for under 10 bucks???Amazing.Needle is strong and the handle of course is cheap plastic but itll only break if you abuse the handle and pump at 50 mph.And gauge was really helpful.I was extremely satisfied.Dont think twice.4.0Nice!Very nice kit.Has everything you need in it.We have filled our bicycle tires, balls and more and this seems to be holding up nicely!5.0Great picturesGreat pictures of soccer all over the world.My son loves this book.Great book for kids that love soccer.5.0Thorough with engaging graphics.Lots of information.A bit above my second grader's reading level, but a handy reference.Great classroom library addition.4.0I didn't think my daughter would like it, but she really does!I was disappointed because it wasn't what I expected.I thought the book was too small and the facts weren't that exciting for a kid, especially a girl, etc.But I gave it to my 8 year old daughter anyways, and she loves it.She's only skimmed through and read a few things (I think that's what she likes about it - you can read it in pieces) - but she said it was one of her favorite gifts.5.0Five StarsThis was a gift and the child loved it.5.0We have been out of town for the holidays but I am confident that once we get home and settle down he will thoroughly enjoy thisI bought this for my son for Christmas.He was really excited when he opened it.There are enough pictures and graphics to grab a nine year old's attention.We have been out of town for the holidays but I am confident that once we get home and settle down he will thoroughly enjoy this book.5.0Franklin Plays the GameThis story is about Franklin's love for soccer.He likes everything about soccer, even his team's uniforms.Sometimes he even wore his purple and yellow jersey and matching knee pads when he wasn't playing soccer.Frankklin practiced in the park before every game, he would kick the ball with the inside of his foot, but the problem was the ball never went where he wanted it to.No matter how many times he kicked it, it always went where he didn't intend it to go.Goose was just walking into the park and she watched Franklin's ball fly the other way into the bushes.They both told each other that they thought they would never score a goal.Goose had trouble because she always forgot that the rules say that she can't touch the ball unless she is the goalie, but Goose's wings were so big that it was hard to keep from touching the ball.Beaver walked up and told them that she had trouble becase her tail was so long and heavy that it dragged her down so much that it was hard to run, but the biggest problem they all had was that their team had never won a game.Their coach always told them to go out and have fun before avery game, and they did, but it would be nice to feel what it was like to win.That day they lost another game.It was an embarassing loss too.Franklin didn't score a goal when he could have and the game ended with all of the team's players ending up in a pile while they were chasing the ball.Coach told them that they had to work as a team and share the ball.Bear's winning team walked across the field and lined up for handshakes with the other team.As Bear came to Franklin he said, "Nice try Franklin."Franklin went into his shell didn't come out.Bear was bouncing the soccer ball up and down and asked Franklin to come out.Bear bounced the ball down and as it came up Franklin came out of his shell and the ball hit him in the head and went flying straight at Goose.Goose spread her wings and stopped the ball dead in it's tracks.Franklin knew what his team had to do to start scoring some goals.His team practiced everyday until the next game and they were really excited to show the other team what they could do now.It was time for their last game and they were ready to show the other team what they had been working on.They went out onto the field and were ready to go, but in the first few minutes of the game Bear's team scored a goal.Franklin's coach called a timeout and told them that it was time for their special play.They went back out on the field and put the play into action and they scored, but it wasn't enough Bear's team scored in the final minutes of the game and won two to one.Franklin's team coach gave ribbons to everyone for their great teamwork and effort and after they all went and got ice cream to celebrate.This would be a good book to read to children because it explains the importance of teamwork.It also explains to kids that it's not always about winning but having fun.Kids need to know about these things because if they don't they can get to competitive and they could get agressive when they don't get what they want.5.0Franklin Plays The GameThis was a very helpful tool to teach my daughter the value of being a team player.It also was helpfull in pointing out that everyone has special skills you just have to look for them.This book also is excelent in pointing out that winning is not what is most important!5.0Franklin Plays the GameFranklin is every young child's friend.They can instantly connect with the young turtle's sense of adventure and enjoy watching him work through familiar problems and solve them in his own way.All of them have been authored by Paulette Bourgeois and illustrated by Brenda Clark.They obviously made a wonderful team, since they have sold over 60 millions copies in over 30 languages.The stories are engaging and the pictures delightful.I love these books!!!5.0Franklin Plays The GameThis was a very helpful tool to teach my daughter the value of being a team player.It also was helpfull in pointing out that everyone has special skills you just have to look for them.This book also is excelent in pointing out that winning is not what is most important!4.0Fun bookI would probably rate this higher, except my daughter wants it read every night, so I've gotten a little tired of it :-)5.0A book my son will readMy 13 year old son enjoys reading it5.0Soccer IQI am an assistant coach for an NCAA Division I women's program and also coach a boys' high school team during the winter.I bought and read Soccer iQ toward the end of the college season and decided it would be a good idea to get our high school booster club to buy copies for the varsity team.I gave them copies just before the Christmas break, assigned them to read the entire book, and told them there would be a quiz when we reconvened.Based on the quizzes I know that almost all of my players did their homework, and based on what they've said, they enjoyed the reading and got a lot out of it.As our season winds down, here are my thoughts on this book and how it has affected our team.For starters, at some point during the season, we've dealt with every one of the chapters.Whether it was the impossible pass or throw-ins or the toe poke, at some point or another each chapter was applicable to my team.The material in this book is very relevant and it's presented in a simple and direct way that makes it easy to remember.My core group of players have really gained a lot out of it.I can see how the things they picked up from reading are being applied during our practices and games, which is really cool to see.But my favorite story is this one, which I've also shared with the author: A few days ago we were heavy underdogs in our district final game.We were playing a much more talented team from a much bigger school, but we went up 2-0 on them by the middle of the first half.Shortly after our second goal, a player of mine was sent off, so we would have to play the rest of the game 10 v 11.At half-time we still led, but the score was now 2-1.As I was trailing the players over to the spot on the field where we were going to have our halftime talk, I was trying to sort out the thoughts in my head as to what I would say to them.But then a bunch of them started saying, "Chapter 50, right, Coach?Chapter 50!"At first I had no idea what they were talking about and then one of them said, "The chapter about clock management."Then I realized they were talking about Soccer iQ.Chapter 50 is entitled Clock Management With The Lead and it provides strategies for shortening the game.My boys are not savvy soccer players.We don't live in a soccer area and I doubt this town has produced a single college soccer player.Most of the guys on my team only play 3 months a year and I doubt any of them have ever watched a game of soccer on TV.But they had done their homework and they had remembered what they read and they went out and killed off the second half better than any high school or college team I've ever seen.It was almost surreal to watch how they milked seconds off of every single restart like they had been doing it their whole lives.They applied all of the strategies in that chapter and held on for a 2-1 win and a district championship.It's really crazy to think that one chapter (three pages) of a book had such a dramatic effect on the outcome of a playoff game.The other big benefit I've come to realize is that because Soccer iQ has addressed so many of the `small' things, it has freed me up to focus on more big picture topics.And when I need to make a correction, a lot of those corrections have been discussed in the book so there's a quicker sense of understanding from the players.Soccer iQ is a fantastic book for players and coaches, and it's a steal at the asking price.As I told the author, we are winning games because of this book, and that's about the best review I think anyone could hope for.4.0Soccer Patterns of Play for the IndividualThis book is well written and contains practical soccer best practices for a player.The author breaks down common tactical situations and provides meaningful advice for them.These situations might be described as patterns of play at the individual level.I recommend this book to players at a U13 level or higher.5.0Every coach needs this book!I've been coaching for many years both Boys and Girls teams.As a coach I always feel that there is something else I should have pointed out to my players, but lacked the insight and or words to convey it to my players.I feel that Dan has touched on many of the "Soccer Problems" that occur in a game but are never addressed by the coach.In each chapter you will find a common soccer problem addressed and dealt with with insight and humor!Like the other reviews I too plan on getting this book for each of my assistant coaches and players.Thanks for taking the time to write this book Dan.5.0Great book for players and coachesA really great read.Each concept is broken down in a very short and understandable way for players and coaches.I coach girls and it's nice to have a book written from that perspective.5.0Fantastic book for soccer players!A really good book.Lots of common sense advice.I read the book and gave it to my ten year old son.He loves it!He has been asking me questions to clarify some of the pointers but generally understands most of the concepts.I really like that the chapters are short and concise.My favorite is the one on using the "toe kick" with a reference to a YouTube video that brings the point home.A must for soccer players young and old.5.0Wall decalMy son LOVES soccer and this wall decal is the perfect size for his bedroom wall, the price was awesome too!1.0came wrinkled and it was hard to put up - ...came wrinkled and it was hard to put up - did not go on smoothly, bumpy because of the wrinkles1.0What a piece of crapI use vinyl to decorate OFTEN!It's cheap but it looks good, most of the time people can't tell if it's paint or vinyl which of course is kind of the point.This however is the worst vinyl I've ever used!It's thick so it is not east to apply at all and somehow in spite of it being thick it tears easy and IT DOESN'T STICK TO THE WALL!I've only had it on for about 3 hours now however the ends keep peeling up and now the center has started to bubble!Wish I would have gotten something else!1.0AWFUL WALL DECALI should have taken all the reviews more seriously.This is just as bad as they all said it would be.No stick to it.Ended up putting it on poster board.Maybe we'll just have to frame it.2.0Hard to applyNot the best product.Came rolled and crumpled.Hard to extract from the backing and difficult to apply.Once you do get it applied, it does look nice.4.0very nice ball.Hard to find Messi signature and my ...very nice ball.Hard to find Messi signature and my son is the ultimate fan.Ball is too nice to kick around.... he keeps it in his bedroom.took about 3-4 weeks to arrive from overseas... and was deflated.I had to run out and get another ball pump since kids lost the other one.5.0Bought this for my 11 year old nephew.Asked ...Bought this for my 11 year old nephew.Asked him to rate it for me and he said 4 and a half.I told him halves don't count, and he said give it a five!1.0 The ball surface have small damage, business management ... The ball surface have small damage, business management is not rigorous.5.0beautiful, but not inflatedheads up - does not come inflated!Ball is beautiful and shiny with signatures clearly printed5.0Five StarsNice ball.Came completely deflated but was not a problem to pump it up.My son is very happy.2.0heavy batThe bat is made of a very hard, sturdy plastic, and I think it's clever how you can store the balls in there, BUT, it is extremely heavy.Neither of my kids can handle it.Have to give it 2 stars because for the targeted age group, it's not so great.I'm pretty sure the non-clear version is not as heavy so we'll be returning this set for that one.1.0Broke immediatelyI should've heeded the warnings of others.The item looked wonderful.My son was really excited.He took one swing and the clear plastic part of the bat broke all the way down.Garbage!2.0Not a good toddler optionThe set is a good height for children 30"+, but it is so heavy.The balls are large and awkward.Even when empty, our son has a difficult time holding the bat properly on the handle and often just resorts to holding the barrel end to swing the handle at the ball.For anyone who has kids who actually play tee ball or peanut league, this bat weighs almost twice as much when empty as an official league bat.4.0I don't believe it will break easy.The person who reported their son split it ...Made very well except the bat is way to heavy for a 2 year old.I think it is more suitable for 3- 6 year olds.I don't believe it will break easy.The person who reported their son split it in half must of been a bigger kid.I would definitely buy it again for kids 3 or older.The durable clear plastic has not scuffed or shown any wear after a weeks use.5.0It has a nice loud bang sound when he actually hits the balls2 year old is in the hitting stage.so we purchased this and have shown him her can hit balls, and we only hit balls.It has a nice loud bang sound when he actually hits the balls.We have had it a few weeks and been playing it every other day and my son finally can hit 90% of the balls, His hand/eye coordination has greatly improved.He loves it5.0Bought for my 8 year old son who read it ...Bought for my 8 year old son who read it cover to cover and now calls out instruction to his teammates based on info in the book.His 7 y/o sister has started reading it too.A big winner in our family and probably appropriate for kids up to 12.Mine are precocious readers.5.0This was a birthday present for my 8 year old ...This was a birthday present for my 8 year old grandson who just started playing soccer.He loves this book and con not put it down.5.0who recently started playing soccer & she enjoyed it a lotThis was a birthday gift for my 9-year-old granddaughter, who recently started playing soccer & she enjoyed it a lot.4.0Great purchaseIt was exactly what I was looking for, it goes in dept of the game, it is not only for kids anyone can read and learn from the information given in this well organized book.5.0Lots of useful information - for beginner or someone trying to understand ...Lots of useful information - for beginner or someone trying to understand technique better.Easy to read, interesting bits of history.4.0It's a cute little kids' book but the "daddy" message ...It's a cute little kids' book but the "daddy" message is a little off-putting.This youngster is afraid of his dad, who forces him to do something he truly fears, dislikes.and dreads.The ending fore-shadows the next book to be equally as fearsome for a lad who would rather be doing math than honing athletic skills on the field.5.0Five StarsEXCELLENT5.0However they are easily adjustable, which is a big plusGoing in I knew these hurdles would be cheap, in fact the cheapest I could find on Amazon.However they are easily adjustable, which is a big plus.The hurdles measure 6", 11" and 14" high, and you can also take one apart to make another higher.I think you can comfortably stack one 20-23" high.One small complaint is that they don't fit together super snugly, and I would imagine that once I use them a little bit they will have an even harder time staying together.To remedy this, I wrapped some red duct tape around the pieces that snap together, and now they fit together much better.I didn't need to do this mind you, but it only took a few minutes, and now I imagine they will hold up for some time without having to mess with them.All in all, you get what you pay for.I would def recommend this product to the trainer on a budget.4.0They're not super robust or machine perfectI'll get this out the way first... the delivery experience was less than desirable and you get five (5) not the four (4) pictured.It also states so.DONE!As for the hurdles, they are well designed, I get it!They're not super robust or machine perfect, but they are durable and VERY functional.They offer versatility and are simple to use.Any trainer worth their sweat will appreciate these.Only time will tell about their durability, but I don't see any major pending problems.The best part is that they fold flat for storage and transport.I will be ordering a second set next week.4 stars for the delivery issues.5.0I love these hurdles for client and patient treatmentHad a piece break and company immediately corrected my problem when contacted.I love these hurdles for client and patient treatment.Highly recommended.Remove clips gently to prevent breaking.5.0Great product!Although on of the extensions came with two broken clips I was able to fix it.Great product!!!5.0Excellent, customer service and support was fabulousExcellent, customer service and support was fabulous.Going to order another set.4.0To be a better soccer coachThis book has excellent, clear advice for coaches who want their players to have top mental strength.I have been a soccer coach for 10 years and thought I knew it all - from personal experience and from various gurus like Anson Dorrance (who wrote the great Training Soccer Champions).From this book you will take away great tips for cultivating self-awareness.5.0A MUST READI am a coach, I have done my coaching courses in two continents, and have played in two continents too.This book has helped me understand the psychological aspects that lead to making good decisions on and off the field of play.This book has not only helped and given me ideas to put into practice for my own teams that I coach, but also for my own well being.The ability to refocus and regenerate my thoughts to help me improve my fitness, morale and playing ability all from simple tools put into easy reading in this BOOK!A MUST Enjoy5.0Outstanding!As a professional football player I must admit that I thought I knew it all.After reading the first pages I was so excited to take my game to the next level that I finished the book within 2 days (I am not a big reader at all).I am impressed by the results , it is incredible how a player has to exercise the mind as much as the body.....I could keep talking about Soccer Tough for hours but I have to say that it is THE BOOK for soccer players that really want to take their game to another level and have great performances on the field....10 stars for me!5.0@insidesoccerSoccer tough is highly recommended.While many people agree that psychology or the power of the mind is the single best determinant of success amongst athletes of roughly similar ability, it is another thing to harness this insight in useful ways.Sports psychology books have historically been, shall we say, a little dry and probably only of interest to a small subset of coaches.What Dan Abrahams has done is simplify the subject ( while respecting the scientific basis) such that this is one of the few books on the subject that I would recommend to players, parents and coaches.I might not give Soccer Tough to a 12 year old but I would certainly give it to thoughtful 14 year old.Another pleasing aspect of the book is that while the concepts are backed by copious research the practical implementation is pretty simple and stress free: create mirror neurons by thoughtfully watching a game;10,00 hours of practice; how to deal with a perfectionist streak.My favorite chapter was the discussion "fire in the belly and ice in the mind."I think he's right but had never thought about it like that.Perhaps the best compliment I could give the book is that although I consider myself a pretty thoughtful coach, as I read through I began to see and understand my players a little more clearly.Its hard to play simply, but i think Dan Abrahams has done a pretty good job of trying.5.0Soccer Tough---Top Quality Book and worth 3 times as much!I am a Behavior Specialist and Teacher that deals day in and out in behavior and psychology as well as an experienced coach.I have read and studied MANY books on psychology, sports psychology and getting the most from students and athletes.I must say, this is the BEST I have come across in my 20 years in the behavior/psychology/coaching field.Dan makes a very complex subject easy to understand and even easier to apply.My 11 year old Goalkeeper is able to make sense of the material and use it to battle the stresses and pressure of being a young goalkeeper in a highly competitive club/league.I can't recommend this book more highly!Can't wait to read his new book, Soccer brain!Mike3.0Very nice but over pricedThese lamps are nice enough for a kids room, but don't be fooled as I was.I found similar lamps in a very well known department store for $10 - $15 less.Usually, I check such things first but admittedly I screwed up on this one.Be extra careful trying to remove the plastic from the shade as it puts dents in the shade and you can't "pop" them out.5.0If yo're doing a baseball theme, get this lamp!Very cute.Cuter than in the picture, and arrived in great shape.I like that the on/off switch is at the top of the lamp instead of on the cord.Makes it easy to use, and we can tuck the cord behind the furniture.3.0Cute lamp, just smallThe lamp is smaller than I had hoped.I also thought the shade was too low, but it serves its overall purpose in my son's baseball themed room.We don't turn on the lamp often; it's mostly for aesthetics.3.0Arrived brokenChristmas gift for my grandson arrived with one of the soccer shoes broken off the base.Took care of it with super glue, but nevertheless the impact upon opening the gift was not completely what I had hoped for.4.0Football theme lampsMy 7yr old son loves his lamps.I purchased two lamps for his football themed room.The lamps aren't too big no too small , they are just right.5.0Must Have for your Soccer LibraryI read 2 or 3 of these self help soccer training manuals each season.Most are laden with drills and anecdotal information about how to play the game.I picked up Dan's book on a whim and was really surprised.The format is different then most with concise and to the point issues.Its a quick and entertaining read and provides straight to the field advice and solutions.Seems best for the older teams but still valuable for the younger kids coach to catch issues early on so you can address before they become real problems.Be sure and get Vol 1.4.0Very helpful but......It was more about different things that might afect game play where as the first one was almost all about technical skills.My dad ordered for me.I'm U12 boys travel.Volume 1 a little more helpful.5.0Every bit as good as the first onei learned more useful nuggets from Soccer IQ volumes 1 & 2 than I have from any other coaching resource in a long while.I work hard to keep up with the game and to improve my coaching and have amassed quite a library of books and DVDs over the year.Soccer IQ is the first resource I've come across in a while that I purchased multiple copies of to give my staff.When Volume 2 is available in paperback, I will purchase multiple copies of that one, too.It is every bit as good.Thanks, Coach!Now please get to work on "Coaching IQ" asap!5.0Substance over StyleCommon sense is totally uncommon on the soccer field.Dan Blank strips away the illusions of style and gets right to the substance of what makes the difference between winning and losing.4.0Good straight forward stuffI like how this is all stuff that you can implement with your team no matter what their baseline skill level5.0Improved Goal ScoringGreat book Mirsad!!!I bought this book to help out my nine year old son become a better goal scorer.By reading your book and applying what he's learned, he has shown immediate improvement...7 goal in his last 4 games!!I too have been reading the book and it has inspired me to get back into the game i left over 20 years ago.Thanks again Mirsad!!5.0GreatThis is a Great book for strikers .If you are a striker don't miss this book.There is a lot of useful things in this book.5.0Great tips for all young players!Simple, concise, easy to read and packed with simple great tips for both the physical and mental skills it takes to be a productive striker.Got it for my 12 year who has read it twice already and always points out stuff he is doing from the book.Definitely recommend the whole series of books from this author.5.0worth every pennyIt is an awsome book.Since i started reading Mirsad's books and follow his ideas, my soccer game has improved alot.it has great details and very informative.it will defenitly help anyone interested in getting better at soccer.will recommand it.5.0More helpful than other books.This book included helpful summerys for soccer.I play in striker where this sort of a book is very helpful.This book might also give you some new ways to defend.No matter what position you play in this book is good, Awesome Job!5.0ExcellentNicely structured and well laid out for young children who are learning to read and looking for topics that interest them.5.0Five Starsgood service.good product...5.0I love the book Breakaway because it gives advice for every ...I love the book Breakaway because it gives advice for every day stuff like friendship and family and also achieving your goals.I also like it because my idol Alex Morgan wrote the book.I want to become a soccer player and be on the WNT.I am only 11 so I have a while until I even hopefully get recruited to professional teams.5.0Great book!We gave this to our 11 year old to read on a road trip.She absolutely loved the book and finished it before we made it home!She's a huge soccer and Alex Morgan fan and loved reading her autobiography.She highly recommends it to others.5.0Football was kind of taboo for women when I was younger so I got very attached to the women's team as a way to be like "See?WomFootball is one of my biggest passions...which is why I was beyond shocked when I found out Alex Morgan's memoir was about to come out and I had no idea!In case you don't know, I've been following the USWNT since I was a child.Football was kind of taboo for women when I was younger so I got very attached to the women's team as a way to be like "See?Women are into sports!And they're amazing!Football is not just for boys!"But anyway, back to Morgan.Since we're roughly the same age (I'm a year older), I've seen every stage of Alex Morgan's career.I think one of the reasons I'm such a big fan is because I've been able to see her grow into the fantastic player she is today.I remember seeing her explode on the field as a sub and thinking that she was going to be huge one day.I love it when I'm right.In this book, Morgan takes you on a tour of her very short but thrilling life.In a way, the writing style is very chatty so you feel like you're catching up with a friend.This works really well since this book is aimed at a younger audience.Even though I am familiar with her career, this book provides a fantastic behind-the-scenes look.Morgan also gives the reader a lot of basic but good advice.I took away a lot from this book and I felt very inspired to become a better version of myself.The release of this book is perfectly timed to coincide with a huge event.Starting June 6, the USWNT are competing in Canada in the hopes of winning the World Cup.You better believe I'll be watching every minute of it.If you like sports or if you want to support a female athlete, pick up this book!Since Alex mentioned (in great detail) the Olympic match versus Canada, I'm going to spend all afternoon looking for that exhilarating game because It.Was.Awesome.5.0I am such a fan(and so is my family)!!Great book!I loved it !Can't wait to read the book to my little sister.And my little baby friend who has a house right behind my family's house.5.0Beyond the goalAlex Morgan has been a favorite of mine since she made her World Cup debut.I am actually only 2 months younger than her.She makes a lot of great points through her stories both on and off the field.I really hope she writes another book later on in her career.4.0Great Soccer training HelpMirsad writes a great book.He has so many helpful hints and tips for all the Soccer positions played.He goes into great depth and explanations regarding the do's and don'ts of the individual positions he's expaining about.His book is a great addition to any player wanting to get better at this sport.3.0Make sure to read the excerpt of the version you plan to buy.This three star rating is not because the book is bad.The information is fine.I just wanted to alert buyers to make sure they're reading excerpts from the right version.I bought it based on the excerpt from the paperback and then downloaded the kindle version.THEY ARE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BOOKS.The content is not the same.Maybe I missed something but I looked again and it still seems different.5.0Love this book.Very good book, easy to understand and it helped my 10 year old son to understand soccer more easily.Since reading it, he stoped using fency tricks and began focusing more on passing and analizing the opponents more often.5.0great tips for my 10-yr-old soccer starThis guide is perfect for my young soccer player!!Each "secret" is easy to read and understand.This reinforces what we have been coaching for the past 5 years.5.0ChristmasWas a Christmas gift for my granddaughter.She loved it so I am assuming it is a good book.Highly recommend4.0Perfect for YA Soccer Fans3.5 Stars A small collection of international soccer stars and a brief bio for each.Most of these players are the latest generation of futbol athletes and have only been active in the international arena for the past 5-10 years.All should be participants in the upcoming World Cup this summer.Great photos.A nice choice for young soccer fans.Net Galley Feedback4.0Great for Young Soccer Fans!I got this book for my eight year old son, who is fascinated by the World Cup, even months after its completion.I read it too, but I am relying on his impressions and comments for this review.He said that the best things about this book were that it had a bunch of players that he could recognize, and a bunch of players that he learned a lot about.He enjoyed finding familiar names like Rooney, Neymar, Muller, Robben and Van Persie, along with players he'd never heard of.He especially liked the "plus and minus" feature, so he could find out what's good and bad about that player.He also liked that most of them were photographed wearing their club jersey, rather than their national one.He especially liked the front picture of the previous World Cup, with Spain lifting the trophy.His only complaint was his opinion that some of the players chosen for inclusion were overrated.As a parent, I thought the book had interesting information about each player.It offered a glimpse into their childhood, insight into their skills and a professional history.I especially liked the way the author dealt honestly and openly about the flaws in each player.Rather than just lauding each one as a hero, the author acknowledged problematic behaviors--like Robben's selfishness and Suarez' violent temper.The photography is beautiful, and features sports action rather than posed pictures.I too liked the "plus and minus" feature, along with the stars showing their position, club and country.The book also included a significant number of players, not just the 10-15 you always see.4.0A fun intro to the world's best soccer stars for younger readers'Stars of The World Cup' came out in plenty of time for this year's World Cup.I just stumbled onto it and decided to give it a quick read.Even though the World Cup is long over, it was fun to relive the player bios.It's features 28 of the players that were prominent in this year's World Cup arranged in alphabetical order.All the major players are here from Messi and Clint Dempsey to Muller and Aguero.Each player gets a two page spread.One is an action photo, the other is a short bio along with a plus and minus score for the player.Pluses include things like 'natural goal scorer' or 'respected leader.'Minuses include things like age or aggression (or lack of aggression) on the field.It's a bright quick read and perfect for sports minded young readers.As a very casual soccer fan, I enjoyed learning more about these players.My son confirmed that the facts were good and they picked the right players to be in the book.I received a review copy of this ebook from Abbeville Press and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.Thank you for allowing me to review this ebook.4.0Great for football fansFor the football addicts out there, this is a book giving data concerning some twenty eight international footballers who were competing for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.Each one has a double page spread with photographs of them in action, a brief biography about them and indications of their main plus and minus features.It includes such details as their date and place of birth, the teams they have played for and their appearances in the World Cup.The action photographs of the players are superb.This will definitely appeal to anyone who is interested in finding out about these male star footballers.Thanks to the author, publisher and NetGalley too, for letting me read an ARC in exchange for an honest review.5.0Great for kids ages 7-12This book is in full color.Each page has a different soccer player had has some stats about them.It reminds me a lot of reading a baseball card.Young boys LOVE this sort of thing.Easy to read.I think it's really for kids in the 7-12 range, but if they were any older, they would probably prefer to just start looking up stats of their favorite players online.5.0Perfect for kids who are passionate about soccerMy son's teacher requires him to read 45 minutes every night so I picked out this book.My son is a soccer fanatic and loves Messi.Reading this book is a lot of fun and is very interesting.Perfect for elementary school kids.5.0Great kids biographyMy 10 year old daughter loved this book.My husband and I also read it and couldn't put it down until we were done.It's a quick, easy and informative read.5.0First book my son ever lovedI'm sure it was the subject matter, but he couldn't wait to read this every night.He would read it before school, and when he was done reading it, twice, he lent it to his friends with great enthusiasm that was contagious.Great for a boy who loves soccer more than reading.5.0Great book for soccer loving kidsGreat book for kids who love soccer for any kid nine up.. Lots if heart and fun to read Would make a great movie!4.0He thoroughly enjoyedMy 8 year old boy that not inclined to read much finished this book in 3 days.He thoroughly enjoyed it4.0Great PurchaseGreat Price.Fast shipping.I have my football on display in my office!2.0Cheaply madeI ordered 2 of these.One of them broke just trying to get it out of the packaging, which was minimal.(One of the pieces that holds the football up.)If you can get it out of the package without breaking the flimsy packing, it will probably last forever on your shelf...just be careful.5.0Great BuyLow cost and does exactly what I want it to do.Great buy for anyone looking for an inexpensive football display stand.4.0Served the purpose.Had three Footballs that I wanted to display and this stand fit the bill.Nothing fancy or too pricey and serves the purpose well.5.0Yep holds a ballThis ball holder is as advertised.Only I was looking for one with clear case around the holder, other than that its great5.0My 7 year old son really enjoys this book....My 7 year old son really enjoys this book.He dreams of being a football player so I started with this book to teach him a little about football before he plays.4.0A learning toolThis was for a grandchild that loves football.He tells me that he has enjoyed the book as a resource material and helping him enjoy the past NFL season.5.0It is a pretty nice book for kids to learn a few things about the game!My son really likes it.It is easy to read and comes with content from the history of the game to tactics and techniques of today.If a kid is interested in this game and wants to learn a few things about it - this is a good way to start.5.0Fun as a Gift!Good content for a 10 year old Football FanThis is a really cute book.My son is 10 and a football fanatic.I bought it for him for Christmas and for a kid that doesn't like to read, he spent a good amount of time going through it!3.0Nice very basic football book for kids !!!!!!It is a nice book for kids.It covers common topics of the NFL, and College Teams but not strategies and deep rules.....4.0Cool helmets, poor boardI purchased this solely for the helmets, and therefore I'm not disappointed.Though the helmets are simple (the design/shape of all of them is the same), the colours represent the appropriate teams and the logos are cool.All teams are represented.Last year I purchased this product as a gift and it included the Atlanta Thrashers; I recently purchased this again for myself from a different vendor (still through Amazon) and it was updated to include the Winnipeg Jets (instead of the Atlanta Thrashers, obviously).Obviously, I'm not sure if there is old stock out there or not.If you're purchasing this to truly be a tracker board, you'll be disappointed.The quality of the board is poor and I don't think it will have great longevity.If you own or have seen the "tracker board" for MLB baseball helmets, it's better than that, but still poor.Personally, I don't use the board.I will either continue to house them in the plastic shell it comes in or I will construct my own "board".Overall, if you just want the helmets it's a very good product.If you want it specifically for a tracker board, buy it for the helmets and build your own board.5.0Fun!We bought these for a friend and then my 5-year-old had to have a set for himself!So cute and fun for the little guys!!5.0Great toy!My son loves the mini helmet sets.He has several college football conference sets and the NFL sets and spends hours playing with them.So these were a no-brainer for us.He follows the playoffs with the included chart and has made up several different games with them.5.0Great toy and bargainGteat Item for kids that love Hockey and want to learn more about teams.6 year old uses them while he is watching the team and also lines them up next to his bed.These were 1/2 of the cost of the same item at the NHL store5.0made a little boy very happyMy son is very into sporting helmets of all sorts.He has just about every football and baseball team out there.This now completes his collection.The face masks are securely in place and they are good looking helmets.5.0It does the job just fineIt's a cube; it's clear; it displays my autographed Carlton Fiske baseball; and it foiled a 5 year old's attempt to open it.What more could I ask?Oh yes, I hope the UV protection preserves the signature, but that review will need to be years down the road.5.0A NecessityOn line is great.I have had a team signed ball for years.Never got around to getting a cube to protect it.This is perfect and inexpensive.Great find.5.0Good productThese are your basic baseball display case.They work just fine and are much more economical than purchasing at any mlb team store.5.0High Quality, Looks GreatThe best quality of the brands of ball cube that I have used.Very clear, easy to place a baseball into this, and you get good value for your money.When you buy a display case such as this, you do not want it to take away from the item being displayed, and this certainly does not detract from my memorabilia being displayed.4.0Good deal and they work just fine!These are inexpensive and they work great!Once you know how to open them (just pull them apart -- the bottom is the part with extra plastic inside that will hold the ball in place, then slide back together) they are super easy and work well.5.0Good bang for your buckPurchased as I needed a ball pump.After reading other reviews, decided this was the best to try for the money.Great little pump.... quick and easy to use.Also has a little plastic storage case and an air pressure gauge.5.0Gets the job done well at a very affordable priceIt comes with 3 needles, a hand pump, a hose, and a pressure guage.You screw in one end of the hose to the pump and the other to the needle, then insert the needle into a ball's rubber stopper.Very easy to setup and use.And it got the job done very quickly.Highly recommended, epecially given that it costs so little.p.s.You can't use it to pump bicycle tire.I wasn't clear on this from the description and other posts when I bought it, and was hoping I could.5.0Good product for the priceIts probably not the best ball inflator out there, but its very compact, has its own case to house everything when caring it around, it inflats my basketball just fine, and come with a gauge.For the price I think it works very well.5.0Works like a champ!Given the price, I was worried about the quality.However this works very well and a great deal.Took care of the whole U-6 team, all season.Nice having the pressure gauge - comes in very handy.4.0Not badThis package came with a pump, a pressure gauge, an extension, 3 needles, and a case to hold it all.Its very compact in the case.The gauge is also very useful.I've used the pump for a few months and it still works properly.I'd recommend it.5.0Good set!Best price on the web, for the same thing other's are selling for $20 more!Glad I bought it for my son!5.0As good a quality as in 1978I purchased three sets for three grandsons.My wife and I bought these for our son (a few teams were different and mascots/uniforms change) in 1978.We have kept all of his collectibles and toys and kept these too, but have lost them.One of these sets is for his son.They are a nice size and the board is good for keeping up with standings, which he did and I know his son will too.Thanks3.0A bit dissapointedThe tracking boards are made out of cardboard and we have already had to tape it to keep helmets secure.Would it really have made much price difference to manufacturer to make this out cheap plastic instead?On the positive side arrived quickly from third party distributor.3.0Great plastic helmets, but the tracker...uggghhhI knew I wasn't getting anything great with the tracker and my main purpose was just getting the helmets.But, the cardboard tracker will probably be ruined before next season... Again, we really ordered this just for the helmets, so I'm still pleased..5.0Love These!I got these for my boyfriend because we are both football fans (i really wanted them for myself) and they reminded me of when we were both younger and they sold them in the gumball machine for 25 cents.Well they are even nicer, they are well made and just fun for when the games are on and you can set them up to face off in front of the tv.Definately a must for any football fan at any age!5.0Love this ball!My teenage son and I love having a catch with this ball.It is a great size - not too small but significantly smaller than a standard size ball.It's just full out fun to play with - fun for all ages!5.0Five StarsI use this football in newborn photography as a prop and it is a frequently requested item for clients.5.0Great to throw around with the kids and adultsThis is a perfect size to throw around with the kids, from the 2-year old up to the 13-year old.It's even fun to throw around with adults since you can really put a zip on your throw.I've purchased several (read as 3) to have around the house, in the car, at the grandparents house.Purchase several, you'll be happy you did.5.0Great size for my 16 month old who loves it ...Great size for my 16 month old who loves it so much he even sleeps with it!Came quickly...faster than estimated.1.0ChineseWhen I read the product description of this football, it was described as the same as it's full size brother, even the "same quality leather", it's not leather, only a smaller version.Earlier I had seen a video on You Tube on how a football was made.It was shot in the Wilson factory in Ohio and the manager stated that all footballs that have the Wilson name on them, are only made in that factory.So I took it for granted that this was an American made football.So I was crushed when I saw the made in China stamp on the ball.Therefore I felt misled and therefore the one star rating.If it wasn't for that, this is a great little football.4.0Cool helmets, terrible tracking boardI purchased this solely for the helmets and therefore am not disappointed.The helmets are really cool with appropriate team colours and logos.They're relatively small, but that's what I expected (imagine a hamster wearing a ball helmet and you get the idea of size).If you want a tracker board, you'll be very disappointed.The board is very flimsy and won't stand up with or without the helmets installed.The helmets tend to shift and fall out of the tracker board with any movement.Unlike the NFL or NHL goalie helmets, the plastic case it comes in can't be opened/re-closed once opened.Otherwise, you could continue to use the outside plastic as a primitive "board".Buy it for the helmets and make your own board.1.0Flimsy, cheapThese are made of very thin plastic; they feel light and cheap, like something you got for 50 cents from a gumball machine.The printing of the logos is poorly done.After a few weeks, many of them had rubbed off to the point of illegibility.Also some of the teams have incorrect (Cubs, A's) or outdated (Blue Jays, Marlins) logos.In summary, these are nowhere near the quality of the mini NFL helmets available.I cannot recommend them.1.0Don't Buy!Bought this item to keep track of the baseball standings.Looked great in the plastic package.However the helments are on flimsy cardboard with half-circle slots.Helmets slide all around and fall out.Also says you can hang but you can't.The backs of the helmets protrude from the rear of the carboard.1.0Cheap, tiny, not what expected.My son has the football helmets and loves them.I wanted to surprise him with these.Well, I think I was the surprised one when he opened them.The plastic isn't sturdy, the size is small, and they seem cheap.I wouldn't purchase them again.I don't think my son cared, but he never used them as much as the football helmets.5.0I purchased these waiting for my son's name to be ...I purchased these waiting for my son's name to be called during the draft.I pre-made a cake and when he was picked by the Brewers I used the hat as centerpiece.This was very convenient because we did not know which team would call.I will keep the rest in case he gets traded for the next cake!5.0Great setI bought these for my daughter's birthday.We played flag tag and they absolutely loved it.They've played with these quite a few times in the last couple months.They still work like the day we bought them.5.0excellentIt's what the description says it is very happy with it I ended buying two sets of them great product and great price5.0Buy it!Great game the kids really enjoyed it velcro works great it is well worth the price!5.0Five StarsMy boys love this - it's been a great gift idea5.0Five StarsGreat for the kids at the park, goes the job.5.0Perfect for the Man Cave Christmas Tree without losing quarters in the bubble gum machinesDon't spend your money in the bubble gum machines.When my boys were small, we tried to collect these from bubble gum machines and never got them all.It was a good way to throw away quarters.Now that the boys are away for college, we set up a nice man cave for them to come home to and put up a man cave Christmas tree.It hit me that if I purchase small hooks from Home Depot, I could screw them into the top of these helmets and make some Man Cave tree ornaments.I was going to put the few we collected on the tree and my wife said, "I wonder if they sell these on Amazon."Yes they do and they look great.Small but still look good on the tree.Get the very smallest hook like in the photo you can find and use a licking wrench to hold them firm so you can apply pressure while you screw them in.Remove the face-mask until you get the hooks in.5.0NFL min football helmetsI choose this item because my grandson loves football.He is five and can name every team.He takes them every where he go.5.0wowthis is a great product.these 32 helmets are very study and durable.they look exactly like the nfl helmets just in a smaller size.also if the face mask falls off the helmet piece it can be easily reatached.it's very difficult to break the piece and it's put together in a very strong way.great product.also at a solid price5.0GreatIf you kid is about 6-11 and a football fan, they will play with these things for thousands of hours.I am not sure why though...5.0helmets are better than helmets had as a kidthe mini helemets are great quality and look sturdier and more professional than mini helmets from youth.The face masks match the color and look of real helmets.Great quality5.0my son really likes thisMy son was 2.5 years old when he got this.He loves that he can get the football airborne when using this.However, for the same reason, I moved it out of the family room to save the photos and ornaments from certain destruction!5.0Kick off teeThis Kick Off Tee made my grandson very happy.He was planning to use it all day Saturday and it was warm so sure he had a great time.5.0It's a TeeGreat basic kick off tee for those Sunday pick up games.Nothing really special about this product, works for what it was designed for.5.0Football teeRubber is definitely better than plastic, as the plastic ones break too easily.This one is good value for the money.5.0Good quality heavy duty plasticBought this as a toy for my seven year old.He enjoys it.Hasent broken.Worth what I payed for it.5.0The best ball pump everI've used two other ball pumps that had build in gauges.Both had a gauge that would screw in the end and were very fragile.One broke, the other has survived, but I wanted something sturdier.This pump is awesome, and the gauge is well protected so no concerns about it breaking.It also has a markings for popular sports balls in the gauge to show the proper inflation in case you aren't sure.It also has a very cool air-release valve, so if the ball is overinflated it's quick and easy to let some air out (with other pumps, I would unscrew the air hose a little to let some air escape, which isn't a great solution).It's obvious this design was well thought out, and I expect it to last a long time.I'll update this review if it ever breaks.5.0great toolThis item performed and did just what i needed it to do in about 5-10 minutes.The gauge seemed to work well - although i do not have an instrument to measure it's accuracy i am pleased with the results.There is an air release button behind the gauge; like other reviewers said, a compartment or grooved slots for the 2 extra needles would have been nice but nothing to remove a star for.3.0Nice design but had to return the first oneThe first one I received lasted less than a day and only pumped up two balls before it stopped working.It seemed like a valve may have gotten stuck on the inside because the pump seemed to be working against itself in either direction.Anyway Amazon was accommodating as always and processed the return amazingly quickly.I tried the new one out on a couple of balls and it's working so far.If I run into any issues I'll keep the review updated.I do like the design and it has a quality overall feel to it.As other reviewers have stated it would be nice if it offered storage for the extra needles but that's not that big of a deal.Aside form the first one breaking this is a pretty nice item.4.0Great, high quality pump with one irritating flawThis is a far nicer quality pump than any of the other portables I've tried.The one down side is that the air release valve is in a terrible position so that you tend to press it as you're pumping, thereby letting the air out of the ball.Therefore, you need to learn to grasp it in a non-intuitive way.If they fixed this issue it would be a perfect pump.5.0Nice ItemThere may be larger pumps but this fills the bill and the basketball.It works well and I love having the pressure gauge on the pump.You don't have to keep taking the needle out and bouncing the ball to see if it' s right.The other thing is you can pump to the same level of preference each time.It comes with three needles so it is ready to go.5.0Fun!There are quite a few stickers in this package, while I expected only 4 sets.These are so fun for the football-loving boys and their friends.They are not messy at all- peel on and off.Will be purchasing these again!3.0StubbornThese were a impulsive inexpensive buy.They are a little on the large size for younger kids and are very adhesive.They will not come off during the game, but can hurt when trying to remove them.5.0For my sonThese yes black sticker were for my son.He said they helped so much that his teammates had their parents to purchase them.His seventh grade team won their county champ ship and they think part of the reason was keeping the glare out of their eyes.I would rate this as a fine product.4.0Awesome!These worked perfect for my superbowl party!The pencil is kind of light thought.I bought Sharpie pens to write on them instead.Make sure you DON'T buy the Sharpie oil-based fine tip markers because they did not work and made it a hassle to decorate on the stickers.5.0Great substitute for party guests:)Birthday party guests put these on instead of party hats to gear up and get ready for some football.My son wrote his name and age on his.Unfortunately, I found them for half the price ($4) at Walmart ... ugh:(5.0Very cool!!!!Very cool.I do wish there would have been some instructions on the fact that the battery was inside and it would light after being blown up!I called and the wonderful person gave me that information!5.0This is a great product.I bought it for my son last ...This is a great product.I bought it for my son last year for Christmas.The light stopped working so I changed batteries but the light just flickered.I called the manufacturer and he explained the problem and is sending me a new casing for the batteries for free!Great customer service!!!!Highly recommend this product.5.0yes, it's a 25$ basketball that will likely not ...yes, it's a 25$ basketball that will likely not last more than a couple of months....but the look on my son's face when he drains one from downtown in the dark is worth its weight in gold.5.0Better than expectedvery cool.was skeptical a bit about the weight of LED and battery and ability to change the batteries, but its really well done.There is a cap-made out of same material as ball- that plugs to cover the access to LED and battery and it will hold in place.It lights up well and uniformly at night and was very enjoyable.BTW, the ball bounces fine.Its an outside ball and not different than other outside balls we have played with5.0Great fun for bored kids.....of all ages!Gave it to my grandchildren who were de"lighted"!!!!Great summertime games after dinner, before bed.Great product.Good price, too.5.0Perfect case to show off these helmetsI've had these helmets for years in the cheesy packaging they came in, and the new (awesome!)wife insisted I get this for the Vikings man-cave.This is well crafted, beautiful wood case with a nice swinging glass door.Came with wall mounting hardware and the all important keys that lock the front door, thereby thwarting any would be helmet thieves.Absolutely worth the $, this adds another nice classy touch to the Cave.....4.0Nice Cabinet for NFL mini helmets !!!!!!Nice cabinet for the 32 NFL mini helmets.It is solid wood with glass to protect the helmets from dust.It includes a little lock with a key.It is designed for Riddell mini helmets which are not included.5.0It looks greatPerfect display case for my son's mini helmets.The shelve on top allowed my son to display some of his trophies as well.5.0This case is made of very good quality & construction and there is real glass on ...This case is made of very good quality & construction and there is real glass on the front.It looks really nice and professional on our office shelf.I was hesitant to spend so much on this, but I'm glad that I did.It looks even better in person than shown in the picture.I would definitely recommend it if someone asks about it!5.0Nice displayLittle helmet look and fit very nicely incase.Easy to display and looks good in game room.Like the lock on case, yes someone could steal off wall but, cannot rearrange the order just for kicks.4.0Good FootballThe tough thing about Franklin's sizing is trying to figure out what is mini vs micro vs junior.The micro fits in an adults palm.The mini is the size Pre-K & 1st graders play with in Flag Football.The junior size is what the 2nd graders and and up use.This glow in the dark football is pretty cool.Doesn't glow all that long, but still fun for the kids.The green part of the ball is a bit slippery for the K players unless they have gloves.All in all, a good football.5.0Glow in the dark footballGood size football for kids between 8-12.Not too hard to cause injury (I even allow my kids to play in the house with it).3.0Does not glow in the darkMy son has been searching for a glow in the dark football - he was hoping this would work.It's well constructed, just doesn't glow as he had hoped.4.0Perfect starter ball for Ages 3-5It's a nice ball.The glow deal is just a gimmick but it doesn't take away from the ball at all and the kids like it.Just don't think you're going to be able to play at night.This ball is a little smaller than the official peewee size that most junior flag football leagues use for under 6 teams.So I think it's a great starter ball to help kids learn to catch with their hands (not their bodies).It's soft enough that if they get hit in the face or body it won't scare them away from trying again.1.0Not a great product.Very slick and smooth surfaceNot a great product.Very slick and smooth surface.We ordered this for our 7 year old son.He had a hard time gripping the ball due to its smooth surface.Ended up returning the item and getting a Wilson junior football, which is what we were hoping to get with this one.Very disappointed.2.0It was a great basketball at first but the composite cover doesn't hold ...We purchased this Spalding basketball for our son in December of 2013.It was a great basketball at first but the composite cover doesn't hold up well to the elements over time.It might be better if it was stored indoors but we don't do that.I'm attaching a photo with this ball and a Nike Indoor/Outdoor basketball that is about 2 years older than the Spalding and both have been stored outside in the same place.You be the judge.5.0Good Quality & Good PriceIn fact, the picture of this ball contains a small mistake.The word "INFUSION" is not printed on the ball at all, and actually the 2nd picture which contains "NBA Zi/O" is the correct one.Note that there are 4 levels for this type of Spaling basketballs: 1.)Professional Game Ball: The official game ball of NBA.2.)Maximum Performance: Ultimate composite leather cover for the highly competitive player.3.)Advanced Performance: Premium composite leather cover for the serious player.4.)Performance: Durable outdoor cover for players of all levels.and this item belongs to the "Maximum Performance".I bought a ball which belongs to "Advanced Performance" level at the Dick's, and it was the same price as this one, which is a better and higher quality ball.Thus, I returned my ball to the Dick's and ordered this one.In addition, this ball is more suitable for indoor play.If you use it as an outdoor basketball, you will need a new one soon.5.0Great ball, nice materialI play mostly outdoors on concrete.This ball has good grip and nice bounce but not too bouncy like rubber so you'll get the soft roll.I've only used it about 10 hours collectively but it has retained it's initial quality so far.The logo's don't interfere much with your shot.I'd definitely get another one.P.S.- Read the item description closely.When I bought this ball there was a picture of a Spalding Infusion basketball with the product description-but it's not.3.0Wouldn't use on rough outdoor surfacesThis is a good ball.It has good feel and all.BUT!I really don't think that this should be labled as an outdoor ball.Mainly because of the fact that the materials really don't last a WHOLE long time before they scratch up and break down.Not putting down this ball or anything, because it's great for indoors...I just wouldn't recommend it outdoors.Thanks for your time!3.0Not the ball in the pictureThe basketball that amazon has pictured is a higher quality ball then the one you get.I ordered the ball thinking i got the Zi/o excel basketball.This basketball is the Zi/o basketball.The excel and this ball are definitely two different balls.This ball is a little harder and not as fine quality.Amazon needs to stop having things like this happen where it puts pictures of wrong merchandise on its website.5.0Very happyMy grandson loves this ball and plays all the time.Nice that it s very soft to kick and can be used in the house5.0Great kid's room decorationMy 9 year old wanted to do a football themed room and we were looking for ideas and found this complete set of team pennants--we decided to use them in a window treatment and these were so perfect that we ordered another set to do something similar in my 5 year old's room!The boys love going through the whole set of teams and even putting them in the order of their favorite teams, etc.I can imagine lots of other uses for these--great buy!4.0They were a hit!The pennants were a hit at my sports party.I recommend them.The only thing I didn't know until I received them was their size.They were larger than I thought (almost too big for what I was using them for) but they still worked out.Just a suggestion to Amazon.com: You might want to list the dimensions of the items you are selling.Thank you!5.0Completely SatisfiedThe pennants are colorful and the material appears to be durable.I used the pennants to make a border around my sons room.5.0Great ProductI am very satisfied with this product; it is as advertised.I would recommend this for anyone looking for an item like this.The purchase was a smooth transaction and delivery.5.0Fabulous...Can't wait to post these flags.I purchased them for my NFL themed party.They will be a wonderful addition to the party.5.0Light Up ActionGreat purchase, great Light UP Action Ball, great service from seller!Planning on purchasing more balls for Christmas and some birthdays.Everybody that I have shared the Light Up Action Ball with has loved it, the kids are blown away.Thanks for the quick shipments and deliveries.Overall, excellent product and service from the seller!2 Thumbs Up!4.0A Fun Tough Ball to UseThis ball is very sturdy and stable.You can punt it without it falling apart.The only down side is that it isn't like a pro football - it's plastic.2.0ACTUALLY THE KIDS LOVE THESE, BUT IT DOESN'T COME IN ANY PACKAGING ...ACTUALLY THE KIDS LOVE THESE, BUT IT DOESN'T COME IN ANY PACKAGING SO GIFTING SUCKS.ALSO THE BATTERIES NEEDED ARE GONNA BE AN ISSUE I THINK.4.0Seller sent a replacement asap and we are very happy with itHad a problem with this football when we got it we couldnt get it to light up.Seller sent a replacement asap and we are very happy with it.3.0Pro is that it's a very cool item, con is it comes it come flat ...Pro is that it's a very cool item, con is it comes it come flat and with no pump!4.0He loves itI got this for my fiance for Christmas and he loves it.It does require some practice though.Anything less than a perfect spiral will not "passback" very well.You will need a ball pump to start using it as it ships deflated.4.0Great for QBsLike it says, the amount of reps you get with this will be insanely high.The spiral back of this football when it hits the wall is decent, only if you bullet the throw and have a tight spiral.It's a decent receiver self training tool.However if is far better than throwing a regular ball in the air and catching it by yourself.if you have another person to throw you a ball, then don't get it.Having a QB with a good spiral and an accurate ball velocity trumps the passback.This is however, a very good Quarterback training tool.Since you have to throw the ball perfectly to get a decent spiral back and you get more reps than you would in practice by yourself or with another person, so the passback is great for QBs, and okay for receivers5.0Not just for kids.Excellent product for the price.I recommend it.I've used it 4 times for a total of 3 hours It's a good tool to practice catching and passing drills by yourself.As a middle-aged man who recently started playing flag football after a 25 year hiatus, I use it primarily to practice catching.I seldom have anyone to practice with outside of team practice.So it's a convenient way to improve my eye-hand coordination and catching skills.The better passer you are the more of a spiral it will bounce back for you to catch.But even if you are a below average passer like me, it still bounces back with a pretty good ball to catch.The ball is college/high school size.It appears to be constructed well and has a good grip.Also, I recommend viewing the practice drills on the PassBack website and on youtube.4.0Target PracticeThis is an awesome tool for one to work on accuracy by them self.Son uses this in a racquetball court to work accuracy and get repetitions even when it rains.Comes right back to you.5.0Nailed itLove it, works great and is a lot of fun.I use it on walls or on the net and it works great comes right back3.0the color is NOT navy blue, it is more ...the color is NOT navy blue, it is more of a purple.i was expecting to pay return shipping but not a $7.99 "restocking" fee..... kinda crummy in my opinion when the color is sooooo off from pic!5.0Super sticky and tacky.These can turn (almost) anyone into a good wide receiver!I purchased these for my husband, this review is from his perspective: I love playing with these gloves, they are incredibly tacky and really help with catching the ball.I'm not an athletic person by any means, but I've made some amazing catches with these gloves.Basically, if the ball touches your hand, you're guaranteed to make the catch.I've used them on defense as well, and they're great.It really pads your hand when catching and defending the ball.I've used them for several months (including a football tournament), and they've held up really well thus far.Make sure to purchase a snug fitting glove, you do not want these to be loose.From a price perspective, the only really comparable would be Nike gloves.Other brands really don't compare to Cutters and Nike.Don't be lured in by lower prices for significantly lower quality.The other brands I've experienced typically aren't as tacky / sticky, or they don't last as long.Pros: * Incredibly tacky * Make you look like a pro * Helps you catch like a pro * Cutters are fairly price effective for the quality (the closest comp are Nike gloves) Cons * None really (though they're a bit pricey for the casual player), they step up your game if you need to catch a ball5.0Great gloves!Great gloves !!!!!!Great quality and durability , ensure you wash them by hand with hand soap and let them air dry .Throwing them in the washer and in the dryer will kill the stickiness to the glove .Stick to that and your gloves should last a couple of seasons .5.0Great gloves worth the price.These gloves were for our son who plays ROTC football.They are breathable and very tacky, making catching a sure thing.He loves them and has been using them for a few months now.No complaints!We were hesitant to spend this kind of money, but we are glad we got what we paid for.Our other son will play high school football next year and this will be in his Christmas stocking this year.5.0Great for law enforcementI am a police officer and most of the gloves for our profession have cloth or no grip leather in the palms.I have been searching for a glove that will help keep a grip on folks when needed.These do the job!4.0It's a nice little...cubeThis is an almost perfect display for baseballs of any type.It is good quality, heavy weight plastic with a non-skid base.Both the acrylic dome and black base are nicely polished and scratch free, but they ARE plastic, so I probably wouldn't use it for a real heirloom piece.Otherwise it it just fine although I did pause for a moment about paying 12 bucks for a plastic cube!There are cheaper plastic units out there, but I am impressed by the quality of this one..so impressed I bought a second at a later date.Why then "almost" perfect?Well, the dome does not fit securely over the base, so it will shift if the kids poke at it or the table it is on takes a hard bump.3.0Solid stand but cover was cheapOverall I was happy with the case for the price, but a little mystified as to why the manufacturer would not make the cover snug around the base.As you can probably see in the picture, the plexi cover goes overtop of the ball and stand but you can slide it around easily.It does not lock into place at all, but just sits on top.The base is sturdy and does not feel cheap.2.0Cover is totally loose, falls off easilyWhile it looks nice, I've been frustrated with the fact that the clear acrylic doesn't attach to the base in any way.It just sits there, and it's very loose and easy to knock off.It looks okay, but it's hard to move it around from shelf to shelf (or from house to house) without the cover coming off or the ball falling down.4.0BCW Baseball DisplayExactly as described.It doesnt close - the top sits on the base so we glued it closed.But we are happy with the size and the quality and feel that we got a good product for an excellent price.5.0PerfectionI purchased this baseball holder for a few balls that were signed by pro's.(Also to ensure that my son doesn't take them outside to play with them!)Now I purchased a few for the ball players on my son's team that hit their first homerun... pretty much for the same reason since the kids would rather play with the ball then to have it on their shelf... maybe it's a mom thing.I want to preserve these special hits : )5.0Great serviceI purchased this ball for a charity event as the Coach will sign this ball.The service was fast and the product just as described.Thanks!5.0Simply perfectThis is a very high quality piece.I purchased this for my husband to take to meet Barry Switzer, and he autographed it and commented on how nice it was...1.0Defective football received - wouldn't recommendI ordered a few of these footballs for a memorial so former ASU football players could sign it.It was our version of a 'guest book' after one of the football players passed away.One of them came completely flat and would not inflate again even when pumped with air: defective.It was incredibly unfortunate because it ruined the memorial 'guest book' and I wish I would have ordered it from a different company.5.0Great PSU Autograph FootballI picked this football up to get signatures of some players on PSU.This ball is really nice, the white works perfect to highlight signatures in black Sharpie!.I definitely recommend picking this up if you are interested in getting a football signed.5.0sharp embroideryBetter than expected quality.The embroidered logo was really sharp.The kids got lots of autographs at a team event.The Prime shipping helped us get this on time so it worked out great!4.0it is a bit harder on the arms because its a semi soft rubber instead of leather but it works just fine.It does hurt a tiny bitordered two of these and they lasted for quite a while!probably 3 hours plus continuously.If youre deciding between a "light charged" glow in the dark vs this LED one, GET THE LED ONE.This one produced a lot of light during our night volleyball game.worked perfectly.As others have commented, it is a bit harder on the arms because its a semi soft rubber instead of leather but it works just fine.It does hurt a tiny bit more if you hit the plug where the batteries go, which is only the size of a quarter on the ball so its not too often.And yes the ball is neon green and orange.It doesnt really matter tho because you only see the red glow during night games.Very very bright.5.0Great for partiesIgnore the reviews about the color of the ball when it's not lit up -- you're buying this ball for when the lights are off / it's dark outside.Who cares what color the ball is?Second, ignore the reviews about the "feel" of the ball.You are not buying this ball for club play, it is totally for fun.After reading the reviews, I was a little skeptical about the ball -- I was wrong.The ball is awesome.It has a rubber feel to it -- not plastic, which makes it much softer and easier to pass than a hard shell plastic ball.My daughter plays club volleyball, so I know what a good ball is and isn't -- this was for her birthday party and she loved it.She didn't care about the color or that it wasn't an official ball -- it was awesome that it stays lit in the dark.Ball lights up on contact, so occasionally it may go out just before you serve it, but just slap the ball and it lights back up.4.0I like it.I think it is very cool but ...I like it.I think it is very cool but my wife who play volleyball thinks it is a little too hard to hit.Meaning that it stings more when hitting this ball than a regular volleyball.5.0Very cool.It lights up just like they said it ...Very cool.It lights up just like they said it would.It is a hard ball but i didn't expect it to feel like a regular ball anyway due to the fact that this ball has a light inside it.Actually a decent ball and i would recommend it.3.0does the jobLights up great but it's a hard ball and where battery goes is weird when you hit it5.0Great, durable teeThis is a nice heavy duty football tee.It does a great job holding the ball and my son has really enjoyed working with it.5.0HeavyThis Tee is very heavy.Just like a professional football kicking tee.It works well.I bought this for just regular use when my son plays with his friends5.0Kicking TeeVery well made, heavy duty rubber.Son loves to use it in the back yard.Definitely would recommend this product.5.0Sturdy and stableI bought this for my 2 yr old and he loves it.He is now 3 and finally able to figure out how to put the ball on the tee by himself so that I don't have to do it every time for him.He feels like such a big boy and enjoys being able to "play football" by himself since he can set it up and then run and kick it.The tee is heavy-duty and very stable so I would imagine that it would be great for teenagers/adults as well.I expect this to be a toy that my son will use for many, many years!5.0Sturdy TeeI can't say much more than this tee appears to be indestructible and does what it is supposed to do.
